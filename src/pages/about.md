**Open Security Data Europe** is a public platform aimed at tracking and
displaying how the European Union spends money on security-related projects,
including on topics related to  policing, border control, counter-terrorism and
cybersecurity. The platform is a tool for journalists, researchers, civil
society organizations and others to better understand the growing investments
of the European Union in security.

The platform contains data on three different EU budgets: the Internal Security
Fund (2014-20), which provided funding to implement EU policing and border
policies, as well as projects by EU member states; the security component of
Horizon 2020 (2014-20), the EU’s research and innovation program; and the
predecessor to Horizon 2020, the Seventh Framework Program for Research and
Development (FP7, 2007-13).

This money has been used to develop controversial technologies such as
[drones](/projects/BorderUAS-Semi-autonomous-border-surveillance-platform-combining-next-generation-unmanned-aerial-veh--168),
[biometrics](/projects/PROTECT-Pervasive-and-UseR-Focused-BiomeTrics-BordEr-ProjeCT), and
[automated behavioural analysis](/projects/P-REACT-Petty-cRiminality-diminution-through-sEarch-and-Analysis-in-multi-source-video-Capturing-and--121), as well as the development of
[pan-European police networks](/projects/ILEAnet-Innovation-by-Law-Enforcement-Agencies-networking) and
[border surveillance systems](/projects/EUROSUR-II-enhanced-operational-capability).
Some companies and organisations have received tens of millions of euros
through these funding schemes.

Our data is all public: either taken from the websites of EU or national
institutions or received via freedom of information requests. You can read more
