**Open Security Data Europe** is a public platform aimed at tracking and
displaying how the European Union spends money on security-related projects,
including on topics related to policing, border control, counter-terrorism and
cybersecurity, as well as weapons and other military equiptment. The platform
is a tool for journalists, researchers, civil society organizations and others
to better understand the growing investments of the European Union in security.

The platform contains data on six different EU budgets:

Three are for projects related to civil security: the
[Internal Security Fund (2014-27)](/programs/Internal-Security-Fund), which
provides funding to implement EU policing and border policies, as well as
projects by EU member states; the security component of
[Horizon Europe (2021-27)](/programs/Horizon-Europe), the EU’s research and
innovation program; and its predecessor programs,
[Horizon 2020 (2014-20)](/programs/Horizon-2020) and
the [Seventh Framework Program for Research and Development (FP7, 2007-13)](/programs/FP7-Security).

And three are for research and development in the military field: the
[Preparatory action for Defence Research (PADR, 2017-2019)](/programs/PADR)
and the [European Defence Industry Development Programme (EDIDP, 2019-2020)](/programs/EDIDP),
the precursor programs of the European Defence Fund (EDF, 2021-2027)

This money has been used to develop controversial technologies such as
[drones](/projects/BorderUAS-Semi-autonomous-border-surveillance-platform-combining-next-generation-unmanned-aerial-veh--168),
[biometrics](/projects/PROTECT-Pervasive-and-UseR-Focused-BiomeTrics-BordEr-ProjeCT), and
[automated behavioural analysis](/projects/P-REACT-Petty-cRiminality-diminution-through-sEarch-and-Analysis-in-multi-source-video-Capturing-and--121), as well as the development of
[pan-European police networks](/projects/ILEAnet-Innovation-by-Law-Enforcement-Agencies-networking) and
[border surveillance systems](/projects/EUROSUR-II-enhanced-operational-capability).

In the military domain EU budgets have focussed on
[uncrewed](/projects/MALE-RPAS) and [autonomous](/projects/ARTUS)
weapon systems, military applications of artificial intelligence, as well as
the development of [hypersonic](/projects/PILUM)
and [directed energy](/projects/TALOS) weapons.

Our data is all public: either taken from the websites of EU or national
institutions or received via freedom of information requests. You can read more

Open Security Data Europe was created by
[Caitlin L. Chandler](http://www.caitlinlchandler.com/),
[Chris Jones](https://cjwords.net/)
and [Zach Campbell](https://twitter.com/notzachcampbell).
The data platform was built and is maintained by
[Simon Wörpel](https://medienrevolte.de). Support for this project comes from the
[Investigative Journalism for Europe (IJ4EU) Fund](https://www.investigativejournalismforeu.net/).

In 2022 the [European Network Against Arms Trade (ENAAT)](https://enaat.org/)
funded Chandler, Jones, Campbell and Wörpel to update and redesign the data
platform, adding new data from the Internal Security Fund and Horizon Europe,
as well as expanding the platform to include EU military spending data,
specifically adding detailed data on companies and other entities benefiting
from the European Defence Fund (EDF) precursor programs in 2017-2020.
Additional research was carried out by Mark Akkerman and Shauna Blackmon.
