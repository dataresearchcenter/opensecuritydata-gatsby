### Internal Security Fund

The Internal Security Fund (ISF) was in place from 2014 to 2020 and had two
components: Internal Security Fund - Police (worth approximately €1.2 billion);
and Internal Security Fund - Borders and Visa (worth almost €2.8 billion).

Some €350 million of the police component and  around €1 billion of the borders
component was managed directly by the European Commission. It was spent on a
broad range of topics, ranging from anti-corruption measures to supporting
civil society projects. However, it also funded work with human rights and
civil liberties implications.

The remaining €750 million (police) and around €1.8 billion (borders)  was
distributed amongst EU member states and spent in accordance with national
plans. For example, to develop the EUROSUR border surveillance system, to
implement the Passenger Name Record (PNR) system of air travel surveillance, or
to construct the Entry/Exit System for monitoring border crossings.

The data on the ISF included in this platform covers 18 EU member states and
comes from the
[European Commission website](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/financing/fundings/overview_en),
the [EU’s funding database](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-results),
the [EU Financial Transparency System](https://ec.europa.eu/budget/fts/index_en.htm),
national government websites and freedom of information requests. Some member
states did not respond to our requests for information; the UK and Denmark did
not participate in the ISF. Member states that did not respond (as of March 2021) are:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Germany
- Ireland
- Italy
- Latvia
- Malta
- Poland

### Horizon 2020/FP7

Horizon 2020 was the EU’s research and innovation budget from 2014 to 2020,
with an overall budget of some €77 billion. The security research component,
which had a total budget of €1.7 billion, focused on “understanding, detecting,
preventing, deterring, preparing and protecting against security threats.”

The program focused heavily on developing and deploying new technologies such
as biometrics, drones, surveillance systems and data-mining tools. Funding was
generally provided to projects undertaken by consortiums made up of different
groups of organisations, such as private companies (ranging from transnational
corporations to small businesses), research and education institutions, and
state ministries and agencies (such as police forces or border control
agencies).

The Seventh Framework Program for research and development (FP7, 2007-13) was
the precursor to Horizon 2020, and the FP7 security research budget was
smaller, at €1.3 billion.

Projects funded through both programs have occasionally come into the public
eye due to their controversial nature: for example, INDECT, TALOS, PROTECT,
iBorderCtrl or the multitude of projects developing drone technology.

The data in this platform on Horizon 2020 and FP7 comes from the
[EU’s Open Data](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/) Portal. The data used
here for both programs is a combined subset of the full datasets, which cover
a wide range of research themes apart from security.
