{"id":"2","name":"3D-FORENSICS - Mobile high-resolution 3D-Scanner and 3D data analysis for forensic evidence","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"Crime is a major factor in reducing the level of civil security. The percentage of solved crime is less than 70% in more than half of the EU countries in some it is less than 50%. A very important part of crime investigation is the capturing and analysis of forensic evidence. A promising forensic approach is 3D-reconstruction of evidence and its analysis but existing systems suffer from low accuracy, flexibility and resolution.\n\nA mobile high resolution 3D-scanning system and automatic 3D-data analysis software will be developed for use at crime scenes. The system will enhance state-of-the-art 3D-laser-scanning devices with much more detailed forensic evidence data acquisition (e.g. of foot prints or traces on bodies) and the software will relieve forensic experts of time-consuming data-processing by hand. A further objective is the realisation of methods to guarantee the integrity of 3D-analysis within the chain of custody from the crime scene to court. The data derived from the system will be accurate, safe from manipulation, convincing and meaningful in order to achieve judicial acceptance. The application of the new mobile 3D-scanner and analysis methods will lead to more effective and successful work by forensic experts with the potential to considerably increase crime detection rates.\n\nThe project includes the development, realisation and test of two prototypes as well as the dissemination and exploitation of the results. Five of the partners are SMEs so the project will demonstrate a more active role for SMEs in the development of new innovative technology in the area of security. One of the SMEs is also an end user. A further public end user is included in the project and an applied research institute supports the SMEs’ development. The users of the developed technology are potentially every crime scene investigation unit and/or forensic crime expert in the world so there is a clear potential and intention by the SMEs to exploit the results commercially.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/data analysis","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312307","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"108475","payments":"8","beneficiaries":"8","total_amount":"1420262.0","startDate":"2013-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The Copernicus era has created a new market with the massive amounts of satellite data that the ground segments of space systems receive serve to the market and governmental bodies. A physical/cyber-attack to their installations or communication networks, respectively, would cause debilitating impact on public safety and security of EU citizens and public authorities. A physical attack on a space ground segment makes the distribution of satellite data problematic and, on the other hand, a cyber-attack in its data storage, access and exchange affects not only the reliability of space data, but also their FAIR standards: findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Current approaches do not fully exploit the recent advances in surveillance mechanisms with robotic technologies and AI. 7SHIELD will be an integrated yet flexible and adaptable framework enabling the deployment of innovative services for cyber-physical protection of ground segments, such as e-fences, passive radars and laser technologies, multimedia AI technologies, that enhance their protection capabilities, while integrating or interoperating with existing protection solutions already deployed at their installations. The framework will integrate advanced technologies for data integration, processing, and analytics, machine learning and recommendation systems, data visualization and dashboards, data security and cyber threat protection. The technological solution is co-designed with first responders’ teams and contributes to policy making, standardisation and new guidelines for contingency planning and service continuity.

ACES has been developed to identify explosive threats with sensitivity and discrimination power orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art systems.  It is unmatched in its ability to screen large volumes in minutes, such as cargo containers and whole trucks, without disassembly.\nThis line of business is backed up both by a very high social demand and a strong institutional support: explosive screening for aeronautical cargo loaded in passenger aircrafts is mandatory in the EU and nearly all nations. This inspection task is presently executed carried out by X-ray screening, which presents two relevant deficiencies: 1) the cargo load must be broken down into pieces where the maximum side is lower than 120 cm, and 2) a human operator interprets the X-ray image, in order to detect  an arbitrarily shaped explosive a few centimeters in size, seen with a depth of 120 cm.\nIn previous years, SEDET has developed an unmatched technology in the area, has been selected as the leading vapor screener developer by several European Union aviation testing Agencies and Israel, and is currently undergoing more thorough evaluations on its way to certification. \nFrom the technical perspective, ACES´s vapor detection technology first turns into ions minute quantities of vapor molecules released into the atmosphere by hidden explosives.  Then these ions are separated at atmospheric pressure according to their size in a mobility filter (a differential mobility analyzer, DMA), and then by filtering the original ions and their fragments according to their respective masses in the vacuum system of a sophisticated triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS).\nACES technology is protected by several patents and patents applications, both in the US and the EU.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/meteorology/atmospheric pressure;/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/sociology/social problems/ageism;/social sciences/economics and business;/engineering and technology/mechanical engineering/vehicle engineering/aerospace engineering/aircraft","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/672001","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"198733","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"863330.0","startDate":"2015-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

ACRIMAS understands the term “system-of-systems” that it incorporates technology, procedures, organisational concepts, and human factors. ACRIMAS addresses this complexity by proposing a pragmatic CM integration process for the Demonstration Phase II implementation.\nACRIMAS is based on wide multi-competence coverage, addressing organisational and legislative frameworks, situational awareness, decision support, logistics, communications, training and exercises, restoration of services and media involvement. ACRIMAS follows a practical, user-centric and scenario-based approach. It will lead to the validation of shared user needs and the definition of a demonstration and assessment method with associated metrics to define a continuous process of capability improvements. End-users, groups, SME, research bodies and governments will be involved to warrant the quality of work and the effectiveness of the dissemination activities.\nThe outcomes of ACRIMAS will be the definition and preparation of this method, documented in a roadmap (Phase I) that will prepare the actual demonstrations and experiments (Phase II). The final objective is to enable a gradual evolvement of CM capabilities, procedures, technologies, policies and standards through real field tests, facilitating European wide collaboration, cooperation and communication in CM and improving cross-fertilisation between MS organisations. The impact of ACRIMAS will provide a solid basis for the description of Phase II, as well as the sequencing and description of the research areas for the future Security Work Programmes.

The technology addresses the public urban piping systems, e.g. for water, gas or district heating, which are today almost fully mechanical, manually controlled and extremely vulnerable with respect to criminal interventions or terroristic attacks. The ACT4INFRA technology has been developed within the past years by the German SME company 3S-Antriebe GmbH. Core of the innovation is a patented rotationally locked support plate (‘System Berliner Kappe’), which enables retrofitting of automated actuators in already existing valves without flanging and without a manhole. Additionally, the actuators have been optimized for low energy consumption and can operate fully decentralized powered by batteries. The entire system is controlled by safety-approved wireless communication systems, fulfilling the strong requirements of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). No construction work for cabling and no switching cabinet is required. The ACT4INFRA system is a key enabling technology for low cost  retrofitting in order to protect vital urban infrastructure against unauthorized access. This allows to implement smart and secure networks of piping systems. Within ACT4INFRA, 3S strives for systematic market development, distribution strategy and effective international commercialization of this technology on abroad, international mass markets. Thus, Phase 1 starts with a feasibility study , where market structure, customer needs, boundary conditions in different countries and geographical areas, cost structures, economy of scale and production strategies are analyzed. An updated business plan with these results will be prepared.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/674379","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"197969","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2015-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Current automatic detection systems have limited functionality, struggling to make inferences about the acceptability of human behaviour. ADABTS aims to address one of the key problems, the definition of abnormal behaviour, by extracting characterizations in realistic security settings based on expert classifications and the analysis of CCTV operator behaviour. A set of behaviour descriptors will be defined and models of threatening behaviour will be built.   Algorithms will be developed that detect pre-defined threat behaviours and deviations from normal behaviour. For accurate and robust detection, data from audio and video sensors will be combined with context information. The trade-off between system generality and capability is addressed by extracting a set of intermediate-level behaviour descriptors that are observable from sensor data. This makes the system configurable to specific needs and improves scalability and cost efficiency. A real-time evaluation platform will be developed based on commercial heterogeneous hardware. Such hardware, in rapid development driven by the video game industry, represents a huge potential for high-performance low-cost surveillance systems. The evaluation platform will demonstrate pro-active detection of potential threats. The context will be large-scale events, represented by a football arena, and critical infrastructure, represented by international airports.

This generates a very large number of operations carried out by law enforcement agencies in order to intercept these vehicles.  During the vehicle interception operations, non cooperative vehicles stop is usually carried out using means which are not always effective, and very often dangerous for the safety and security of vehicle occupants and law agents. The law enforcement agencies in charge of this operations acknowledge that new control and interception means and procedures are needed in order to increase their capabilities to track and intercept the suspicious vehicles, minimizing all kind of risks for vehicle occupants and agents, and using the lowest possible volume of highly trained human resources.\n\nThe present project aims precisely, at increasing the capability of law enforcement authorities to remotely, safely and externally, control and stop non-cooperative vehicles in both land and sea scenarios, by means of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. For this, the UAV has to be equipped with some onboard system(s) providing the capability to intercept (slow and stop) the vehicles, and this is precisely the concept of the AEROCEPTOR system proposed in this project: AEROCEPTOR will be an unmanned aerial vehicle, supported by a Ground Control Station infrastructure, and equipped onboard with a set of several systems to perform the car/boats interception.\n\nAEROCEPTOR aims at offering a cost effective solution taking advantage of already existing systems and Components of the Self. This means that AEROCEPTOR will take advantage of the existing equipments and systems to adapt them to the project if possible. In those cases where the necessary subsystems do not exist or do not meet AEROCEPTOR needs, they will be developed.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/social sciences/law;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/robotics/autonomous robots/drones","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285144","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"106475","payments":"15","beneficiaries":"15","total_amount":"3468859.75","startDate":"2013-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-05-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

There is a major security requirement is for a new reliable detection method of explosives, especially at soft targets. The ideal solution is a robust in-situ method for rapid non-invasive detection of hazardous materials, including explosives, that is portable and can be located at borders, ports and other sensitive targets around Europe.\nThe most powerful and promising method being adopted for in-situ observations of suspicious substances to detect explosive is Raman spectroscopy. All molecules provide a unique Raman signature making the method very flexible and effective. However, Raman observations thus far have proven unreliable in the field, due to the very weak signal strength, background fluorescence masking this signal and complicated spectral returns that are difficult to interpret in the field.  \nIn this project ISI will seek to develop an Advanced Intelligent Raman system (AIRS) that builds on the strengths of the Raman observational approach, and dramatically reduces it current limitations of existing instrumentation. \nAIRS will achieve this by combining three technology development to produce a new portable easy to use chemical identification instrument. Specifically the instrument will use a Time resolved measurement technique using advanced detector technologies to remove the fluorescence and improve the signal to noise of observations. Machine learning analysis tools to interpret instrument returns in the field quickly and efficiently allowing for multiple species to be identified.

As maritime smuggling from Morocco towards the European borders of Portugal and Spain was combatted more effectively, the criminal modus operandi changed drastically, approaching air routes with cheap and small planes. New drone technology opens opportunity to both manned and unmanned airborne drug transports. Launched from any location and moving at low altitude and speed to mask their presence with the present clutter environment, drones can autonomously reach any landing site under nearly all circumstances.\nThe ALFA system bridges this detection capability gap by drastically improving the situational awareness through the detection of LSS (Low, Small and Slow) manned and unmanned aircraft. ALFA is future-ready as technologies for drone detection will be a part of the system, which will use heterogeneous, easy-to-deploy mobile sensors based on several novel technologies. All sensor data, augmented by other existing sources of information, will be combined using evolved data fusion, providing accurate positional data for targets including eventual indication of the air vehicle type and reliable prediction of its landing site. This information will be communicated to the regional law enforcement units using a secure communication link and mobile device application, drastically improving the reaction time.\nFinal ALFA capabilities will be demonstrated in a realistic operational context using relevant targets and in close cooperation with two principal end users taking part in the consortium.

In this project, we will target the most lethal types of BoNTs: A (subtypes A1 and A2), B (B1 and B2) and E (E1). The antibodies will be directed against the C-terminus of the heavy chain and the light chain of each of these three BoNTs, as these domains contain neutralizing epitopes, according to the latest scientific data. The six corresponding immunogens will be produced in recombinant form, and utilized to immunize macaques (Macaca fascicularis), from which phage-displayed immune libraries will be built. Utilizing the phage technology, scFvs cross- reacting with A1 and A2, or B1 and B2subtypes will be panned.

The set of solutions will be designed to achieve required levels of multi-party trust with efficiency, ease of adoption and convenience for all end-users (citizens, law enforcement, businesses), consolidating Europe as world leader in enhanced identity-based services as a basis to boost the competitiveness of its economy. \n\nARIES will leverage virtual and mobile IDs cryptographically derived from strong eID documents in order to prevent identity theft and related crimes in the physical (e.g. an airport) and virtual (e.g eCommerce) domains. Both, the derivation process, and the derived IDs will be univocally linked to citizens' biometric features, increasing the level of identity assurance during the credential issuance process and during authentication. Highest data protection standards will be followed to provide digital privacy-preserving features. Thus, the project will provide a global approach for ID Ecosystem in Europe to address European-specific concerns to improve identity, trust and security, and better support the law enforcement to address the new threats in cybersecurity while achieving far-reaching socio-economic positive impacts.\n\nARIES will demonstrate its outcomes and the levels of identity prevention reduction achieved in two use case demonstrators (secure eCommerce and identity virtualization for secure travel), covering the complete vision of virtual id ecosystem and its practical application.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/law;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700085","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202675","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"9","total_amount":"2247002.5","startDate":"2016-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-02-28 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Given the continuously evolving and shifting security threats, and passengers being increasingly dissatisfied with queues and intrusive measures, the industry agrees that today’s model is not sustainable in the long term.\n\nGoal of the overall ART initiative is the exploitation of novel Alarm Resolution Technology (ART), using novel patented X-Ray Echo Methodology, for various promising security domains. The proposed ART method of scanning, detecting and characterization is based on an all-new high-energy x-ray Rayleigh scattering technology. In the last two decades, the concept was developed based on a high energy x-ray source, using specific beam widths and collimation techniques, under specific angles/constellations for beam to sample to detector, using new semantic data-analysis methods and ‘fingerprinting’ algorithms. The Entech approach is fundamentally different from existing scanner technologies. The main paradigm in the ART project promotes a shift from just making an image, towards high-throughput measuring and characterizing of materials and fluids.\n\nSpecific objectives in this ART H2020-SMEINST Phase 1 study proposal are:\n- Explore business cases for a variety of security domains and applications.\n- Evaluate the required specifications of such applications with potential customers.\n- Elaborate a detailed business plan.\n\nEspecially on the Smart Security initiative of the International Air Transport Association policy on Liquids Aerosols & Gels (LAGs), we expect the ART platform to become (one of the) breakthrough technology enablers with the unique selling points to detect explosives, narcotics and CRBN’s solved in LAGs efficiently and cost-effectively in a growing global multi-billion market.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/674563","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"197971","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2015-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Starting from a synthesis of state of the art discussions on societal security, we will identify best practice cases exploring and assessing societal impacts of science and technology in the security domain and beyond, and carefully analyse their structural properties. This will be done in a multidisciplinary fashion from different perspectives, including end-users, stakeholders, researchers, policy-makers and NGOs.

The need for more agility in software development and maintenance has also fostered the transition to micro-services architectures, and the wide adoption of this paradigm has led service developers to protect their applications by including virtualised instances of security appliances in their design. Unfortunately, this often results in security being managed by people without enough skills or specific expertise, it may not be able to cope with threats coming from the virtualization layer itself (e.g., hypervisor bugs), and also exposes security appliances to the same threats as the other application components. It also complicates legal interception and investigation when some applications or services are suspected of illegal activity.\nTo overcome the above limitations, the ASTRID project aims at shifting the detection and analysis logic outside of the service graph, by leveraging descriptive context models and their usage in ever smarter orchestration logic, hence shifting the responsibility for security, privacy, and trustworthiness from developers or end users to service providers. This approach brings new opportunities for situational awareness in the growing domain of virtualised services: unified access and encryption management, correlation of events and information among different services/applications, support for legal interception and forensics investigation.\nASTRID will develop a common approach easily portable to different virtualisation scenarios. In this respect, the technology developed by the Project will be validated in two relevant domains, i.e., plain cloud applications and Network Function Virtualisation, which typically exploits rather different chaining and orchestration models.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/software development;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786922","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"214855","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"2932297.5","startDate":"2018-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2021-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The planned impact is three-fold: the reliability of biometric systems becomes standardized and comparable, potentially leading to a meaningful increase in their performance; technology transfer from research to companies becomes easier with the use of an interoperable framework; authorities and decision-makers become more informed about the progress made in biometrics as results impact standards.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/access control","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/284989","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102363","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"3499784.0","startDate":"2012-03-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-02-29 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The project will provide evidence that will be useful to first responders, building designers and those involved in the development of emergency operating procedures for buildings.  The BeSeCu project employs two research strategies: A) A cross-cultural survey of individual experiences will be conducted to identify determinants of inter-individual differences in people who have experienced evacuation situations, fire disaster survivors and survivors of similar crisis situations, but also workers and first responders as well as those affected in the community. This retrospective study will be carried out across 7 European countries with diverse cultural background. B) Experimental trials will be carried out in three countries simulating real time evacuation scenarios in standardized settings including objective measures (e.g. response time) as outcomes as well as video-tape analysis. Results will be analysed to identify similarities and differences between cultures and ethnic groups as well as a range of socioeconomic factors. The analysis will triangulate findings obtained with objective measures, subjective experiences and behavioural observations.  Two types of research findings and products will be provided by the BeSeCu projects: (A) An evidence base that will enable designers of buildings to develop culturally appropriate emergency operating procedures.  (B) An evidence base of inter-individual differences that will be employed to develop a culture sensitive communication training to improve emergency interventions. The research will be carried out by a consortium of 8 European partners including end-users (e.g. fire service colleges) in the process of research.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/218324","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"86260","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"2093808.0","startDate":"2008-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2011-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},
{"id":"58","name":"BESECURE - Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Environments","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"Urban security is a complex multi-dimensional process that results from the interaction of an increasingly diverse collection of stakeholders. Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.\n\n\n\nThe project ‘Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions’ (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas. By examining 8 urban areas throughout Europe, BESECURE will build a comprehensive and pragmatic set of indicators, and a pragmatic risk assessment model that can provide cues about the development of certain scenarios. BESECURE will improve urban security policy making by sharing best practices that are in use throughout Europe, and by providing visualisation and assessment tools and guidelines that will help local policy makers to assess the impact of their practices, and improve their decision making.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285222","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102646","payments":"15","beneficiaries":"15","total_amount":"3468092.0","startDate":"2012-04-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Although these attacks had been punctual and crude, more sophisticated attacks on dozens or hundreds of injured or killed people are conceivable. When launching such an attack its success depends on concentrating a sufficient amount of pathogens in a defined area.\n\nHence safeguarding a certain area regarding biological agents demands the detection of pathogenous bacteria, spores and viruses in various matrices (e.g. Anthrax in flour or sugar) or suspicious aerosols. This can only be accomplished by triggering a short-term alarm and its validation as well as the identification of the type of threat.\n\nSince most of the bio sensors available are laboratory bound or require special equipment which needs training as well as experience, new systems are needed.\n\nThe concept of BIO-PROTECT is the development of a fast-alert, easy-to-use device to be applied for detection and identification of airborne bacteria, spores, viruses and toxins . Its technology is based on bioaerosol detection by fluorescence, scattering and background aerosol measurement followed by ionisation of air flow and analysis of the spectrum of relative speed of passage, which, in turns, enables identification of harmful biological agents.\n\nThis device may also be used for controlling potential accidental release of bio-agents from biotechnology laboratories.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/biological sciences/microbiology/virology","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242306","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"94692","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"9","total_amount":"3125577.0","startDate":"2010-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Besides, potential terrorists might threaten water infrastructure in European cities, since poisoning the tap water is a low-cost attack that easily generates social panic and economic loss to the society. Due to lack of the ideal early warning tools on water safety, large amount of routine sampling and testing have to be done frequently to fight against possible CBRN threats on urban water supply. This project addresses feasibility study for the technical and economic viability of Biological Water Alarm System (BiWAS): An innovative low-cost early warning device for monitoring of drinking water safety over a broad spectrum of harmful substances, including (1) acute toxicant chemicals, (2) chronic carcinogenic chemicals, and (3) waterborne pathogens. The innovative content of BiWAS lies in the miniaturisation and integration with multidisciplinary knowledge, which makes BiWAS a continuous, automatic and portable device working for long period with only annually or biannually maintenance. The potential customers include public water suppliers, household users, hospitals, hotels, culinary and food industries, etc. An early warning system against CBRN threats in drinking water can be realized without more investment. A feasibility assessment on BiWAS product under Phase 1 includes market investigation, business plan development, risk assessment, intellectual property management and innovation strategy development. In the potential Phase 2, a commercializable prototype of BiWAS will be expected, which can be probably the first low-cost and broad-spectrum early warning device for water safety. With the outcome of Phase 1, it will guide the European companies towards the leading role of the global water quality monitoring techniques, and open a big door to the large market of global water quality monitoring, from Europe to the world.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/664032","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"197291","payments":"2","beneficiaries":"2","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2015-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-07-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The BOOSTER project addresses this requirement under Security Topic SEC-2009-4.3.2 – Bio-dosimetric tools to manage radiological casualties. Current biodosimetric approaches frequently involve cytogenetics. The analysis of dicentric/ ring chromosomes is the mechanism of choice for precise estimation of an individual’s exposure. Current optimisation of such analyses involves the automation of various steps in the process. However, chromosome analyses are performed on the first mitosis post-exposure and thus a significant limiting factor remains a cell culture step (2 days) that is impossible to reduce. New biodosimeters are required that may not bring the same precision as cytogenetic analysis but will permit triage in the first hours post-accident into three populations (i.e. to identify individuals that require no further intervention, those who require close follow-up and those who require hospitalisation). BOOSTER is a capability project designed to research and develop new bio-dosimetric tools in order to quickly evaluate the level of potential casualties, determine by appropriate sensors their consequences, allow an efficient triage of exposed people, integrate a useful and usable toolbox, train civil protection operators and define commercial exploitation potentialities. The BOOSTER project will use an integrated approach to deliver new bio-dosimetric tools. We propose to optimise existing tools for assessment of a radiological situation and to develop novel biodosimetric procedures for estimation of radiation exposure in cells from patients. These approaches will be combined in a prognostic toolkit that will allow effective management of exposed persons presenting at triage.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/biological sciences/genetics and heredity/chromosome;/social sciences/sociology/industrial relations/automation","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242361","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"94818","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"3284291.0","startDate":"2010-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

If you transport or store goods, it is difficult to know that your goods were treated correctly. For decades the supply chain industry has depended on bolt/cable seals, documentation and locks, knowing that these provide extremely limited safeguards and evidence trails. As a result theft, people trafficking and narcotics smuggling are rampant. An estimated 8% of medicine sold worldwide is counterfeit (Source: WHO 2015). Improper storage is detected too late to prevent waste. In addition, inspection delays are a major cost in the total supply chain.\n\nBabbler uses IoT and an inverted evidence principle to provide much better assurance of cargo security problems. In 2015 we were selected for an accelerator in the EU FIWARE program and in that accelerator won a cash prize for best startup in 2016. The accelerator provided funding so we could create and test a solution for shipping containers with business partners (Royal FloraHolland, Dutch Customs Organisation, Seatrade and others). \n\nAlthough Babbler proved its value in those trials and is attracting international interest, the shipping industry is conservative and slow-moving. To use Babbler a number of links in the supply chain have to decide to work together, which makes the buying process slow.

To achieve this, different Command and Control (C2) Systems and Sensor Systems have to cooperate which would only be possible through interoperability. However, unless standards and well-defined specifications are used, the interoperability of these systems can be very complex. To address this challenge, in C2-SENSE Project, a “Profiling” approach will be used to achieve seamless interoperability by addressing all the layers of the communication stack in the security field. In this respect, C2-SENSE project's main objective is to develop a profile based Emergency Interoperability Framework by the use of existing standards and semantically enriched Web services to expose the functionalities of C2 Systems, Sensor Systems and other emergency/crisis management systems. This will be developed in three steps: (1) first, an Emergency Domain Inventory will be created by surveying existing standards, real life use cases of sensors, devices, C2 systems and emergency management architectures for different scenarios in security field.  (2) Based on this inventory, a common Emergency Domain Ontology will be developed to gather all stakeholders' knowledge in a unique and flexible data model. (3) Finally, by using the concepts in this ontology, by also taking into account both functional and operational requirements as well as different countries' cultural, linguistic and legal issues, Emergency Interoperability Profiles that will constitute the framework will be developed. The necessary standardization activities will be initiated to evolve C2-SENSE Emergency Interoperability Framework into a standard specification for interoperability between Sensor Systems and C2 Systems.

These can be manned or unmanned, ranging from sensors (optical, radar, IR) to unmanned platforms (UAV, UGV, USV or UUV), and need to be combined to offer an integrated situational picture of the area under surveillance and of their location. In order to effectively control their operation and manage the large amounts of data collected by them, new approaches for command and control need to be considered, allowing efficient interaction between the operator and the different assets in the field. CAMELOT proposes to develop and demonstrate different advanced command and control service modules for multiple platform domains, based on a SOA architecture that specifies internal and external interfaces, allowing the development of a modular and scalable command and control station, customisable to the user needs. This architecture can be based on results of previous studies and work or open architectures that may prove more suitable and the interfaces can take advantage of the standardisation work that has been done already. After the definition, CAMELOT partners will prototype service modules according to their expertise, background individual technologies and practitioner needs. These will be integrated progressively in specific testing along the project.

Technology developers as well as legal and philosophical scholars and empirical researchers have dealt for many years with cybersecurity issues, although from very specific angles. What is missing is community-building that unifies these perspectives from the presupposition that technology development in cybersecurity should incorporate European values and fundamental rights. Constructing this community – an alliance for value-driven cybersecurity – is the central aim of the CANVAS consortium.\nCANVAS consists of partners from different scientific traditions – ethical, legal, empirical and technological – with unique competences and broad contact networks such that they can serve as “seed crystals” for community-building. The consortium will take three domains of application with unique value-profiles and complementing cybersecurity exigencies – the health system, finance, and police / national security – as starting point for outlining problems related to value-driven cybersecurity. Using a three-step process, CANVAS will (1) structure existing knowledge, (2) design a network for exchanging knowledge and generating insights across domains, and (3) disseminate the insights gained through three means: A reference curriculum for value-driven cybersecurity with a focus on industry-training, briefing packages for policy stakeholders, and a MOOC (massive open online course) on value-driven cybersecurity. Furthermore, the alliance that should result from this community-building will allow for self-organization among alliance members for tackle specific research questions that emerge out of knowledge exchange in future proposals.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700540","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202697","payments":"13","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"1000000.0","startDate":"2016-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The future research agenda for security in land transport which CARONTE will provide, focuses on core relevant gaps caused by emerging risks and will avoid doubling in research. For this CARONTE will provide answers to the question of what type of security related projects should be planned in the future, considering the current state of the art and existing research projects. It will cover all threats (including cyber-crime) and security aspects for all land transportation modes, respecting fundamental human rights and privacy.  The step by step method includes analyzing the state of the art and emerging risks, identification of gaps, analyses and assessments of potential solutions and the research agenda.\nThe CARONTE consortium consists of universities and research institutes, providing well experiences (research and consultancy) in transportation, logistics, infrastructure management and security.

Towards this evolution, CIs and companies offering CI services had to adopt many of the recent advances of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) field. This adaptation however, was rather hasty and without thorough evaluation of its impact on security. The result was to leave CIs vulnerable to a who the new set of threats and attacks that impose high levels of risk to the public safety, economy and welfare of the population. In so far, the main approach to protect CIs is to handle them as comprehensive entities and offer them a complete solution for their overall infrastructures and systems (IT&OT departments). However Complete CI protection solutions exist in the form of individual products from individual companies. These products integrate only and tools/solutions designed by the same company, thus offering limited technical solutions. The main aim of CIPSEC is to create a unified security framework that orchestrates state-of-the-art heterogeneous security products to offer high levels of \nprotection in IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) departments of CIs. As part of this framework CIPSEC will offer a complete security ecosystem of additional services that can support the proposed technical solutions to work reliably and at professional quality. These services include vulnerability tests and recommendations, key personnel training courses, public-private partnerships (PPPs) forensics analysis, standardization and protection against cascading effects. All solutions and services will be validated in three pilots performed in three different CI environments (transportation, \nhealth, environment). CIPSEC will also develop a marketing strategy for optimal positioning of its solutions in the CI security market.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700378","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202692","payments":"14","beneficiaries":"14","total_amount":"5033443.75","startDate":"2016-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The years 2010-2014 have seen a rapid upsurge of smartphone apps aimed at improving crime reporting and other forms of UGC and interaction associated with community policing. Yet these apps are characterised by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon approach with the largest number originating in the USA, a few in Canada, Australia and with the UK apparently the only major EU state where there has been some take-up of these technologies. CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining “local flavour” and diversity. These ICT solutions will also be designed from scratch to be fully compliant with strict privacy and data protection laws. A training scheme, including use of serious games, will be developed to assist training of officers and citizens in use of the app and portal.  CITYCoP will benefit from a multi-disciplinary approach that will include the sociology of community policing as well as cognitive science perspectives of the citizen’s interaction with community and LEAs through technology.  The partners in CITYCoP build on long years of successful collaboration in EU projects dealing with UGC, smart surveillance and privacy (CONSENT, SMART, RESPECT) positioning CITYCoP solutions to achieve integration into smart city eco-systems.

This would allow to constitute a more coherent and interoperable platform. As a result, common understanding and situational awareness about crisis management in EU civilian external actions will be enhanced since CIVILEX paves the way for such an infrastructure. The envisaged platform should facilitate the engagement of EU actors. This can include CSDP missions, EU Delegations, ECHO offices and Member State Embassies, but also UN offices and other non-EU actors. While the focus is on the civilian chain of command, it should also consider certain connections and overlaps with military actors. The need for coherence and interoperability is not new, nor is it a purely technical challenge. Clearly, there are certain legal, policy, institutional and human elements that function as facilitators and constrainers for better information exchange. \nCIVILEX, therefore, adds an innovative dimension by researching and helping to clarify the wider policy, institutional and operational issues of ICT systems in the context of CSDP and EU external action.

Most academic and policy initiatives to date have focused on the direct security impacts of climate change in Third Countries and/or on the indirect impacts on international security (e.g. concerning regional economic or political stability). While those initiatives offer invaluable insights, CLISEL is based on the presumption that many indirect impacts on Europe’s security emerge and are felt at the local scale, within Europe itself. This is overlooked by most existing initiatives on the so called climate-security nexus, and the conditions under which local authorities act upon climate change (in)security within their operations are not well understood. \n\nTo fill this gap, CLISEL explores the climate-security nexus from the perspective of local administrations and communities, based on the idea that innovations in the exercise of regulatory power of local authorities can contribute to enhance the understanding of the indirect security implications of climate change in Third countries, as well as to take proactive action. In particular, CLISEL looks at the issue of climate-induced migration, an issue often cited as an indirect security dimension of climate change, from the perspective of local administrators in Sardinia. The aim is to understand the extent to which migrants from ecologically vulnerable Third Countries are perceived as a security issue, the reasons why that is (not) the case, as well as the policies and actions through which local administrators can ward off the emergence of security crisis within their territory.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology/climatic changes;/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700385","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202693","payments":"5","beneficiaries":"5","total_amount":"889205.0","startDate":"2016-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

(c) To localize the source into a cargo and estimate the radioactive source activity taking information about the source environment (shielding, absorption in the surrounding materials) (d) To work at a wide range of absorbed dose rates by adjusting the effective volume of the detector.  The above capabilities will improve the quality of the data gathered by the customs officers during the routine inspections at the boarders and will assist the first responders in case of a radiological or nuclear emergency to estimate the exact situation. Basic tasks of the project will be:  (a) The growth of high purity, detector grade Cd(Zn)Te crystals. Their performance will be optimized by material purification, selection of right dopants and post-growth processing to obtain high resistivity, high transport properties and homogeneous distribution of these material properties in the grown crystals. The growth of crystals with a diameter up to 75 mm will be performed.  (b) The fabrication of pixel detectors having structure of p-n and Schottky diodes.

Current sensing methods suffer from susceptibility to false positive results due to environmental contaminants, or false negative results to interfering compounds. The need exists for a single distributed network, with a common interface and communications protocol, to manage and communicate with a variety of different sensor technologies, and use the combined sensor data to produce clear and unequivocal results with low false positive/negative readings.\n\nThe goal of the CommonSense project is to create and demonstrate this sensor network, through the simultaneous and parallel development of novel materials, portable sensors and a wireless communications network, which uses chemometric data processing algorithms to “learn” to recognise trace amounts of explosives, and differentiate them from interferents. The partners will produce a series of novel organic, polymeric and nanocrystalline materials with tuned optoelectronic properties and surface affinities to be used as the active sensor elements. These elements will be incorporated into devices based on optical, electrical, and other readout mechanisms, for detection of airborne and waterborne analytes.\n\nThe CommonSense project will also incorporate radiation detectors to detect this growing security threat of “dirty bombs”, where sub-critical amounts of radioactive materials, obtained from medical waste or other sources, are incorporated into IEDs. The key point in the use of such a variety of sensor technologies is that no one substance can act as an interferent to all of the sensors, thus reducing false positives and negatives. Eliminating the remaining false readings will be achieved through use of the chemometric algorithms in order to teach itself to recognise the “fingerprint” sensor response to different explosives types and ignore interfering compounds.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/data processing","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261809","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"97603","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"8","total_amount":"3689590.0","startDate":"2011-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Within this context, authorities in charge of border and maritime patrol are faced with different challenges that include the heterogeneity of the traffic that undertakes illegal activities in European waters, limitations in the ability to collect and share timely available data among institutional organizations, as well as a lack of assets by the relevant authorities to cover the wide maritime areas under their mandate. Although there has been an expressive investment done in the domain of surveillance technologies and tools, the intake by the competent authorities has been slow, due to lack of uniformity in the integration of such systems with existing surveillance infrastructures. In order to address these challenges, project COMPASS2020 aims to demonstrate the combined use and seamless coordination of manned and unmanned assets to achieve greater coverage, better quality of information and shorter response times in maritime surveillance operations. The proposed solution will be based on an innovative CONOPS that makes use of multiple aerial and underwater unmanned vehicles with improved capabilities, deployed from OPVs or from land, and will be supported by a central, multi-domain and interoperable Mission System (MS) that enables the operation of these platforms from both locations. UxVs may act as deported ship sensors, providing critical mission data to the MS that can then be exploited through dedicated services to be developed in the scope of the project (e.g. Data Fusion and Threat Risk Analysis). The major goal of COMPASS2020 is to demonstrate an operational solution to ensure long range and persistent surveillance, increasing the situational awareness of coast guards and maritime authorities, and, thus, increasing the cost-effectiveness, availability and reliability of the operations.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/social problems/migration;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833650","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"222617","payments":"14","beneficiaries":"14","total_amount":"4838489.61","startDate":"2019-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Integration in the EU has increased the need for cross force collaboration. Technology has created new capabilities for criminals but also possibilities for the police. Changes in the public opinion and in political expectations have created extra challenges. Responses to these challenges and exploitation of opportunities require major changes to the culture and structure of police forces, but these are far from trivial and how they need to be implemented differs from one country to another. So far, change management in police organizations has not been addressed in a comparative interdisciplinary study with a European scope. Based on a study of police forces in 10 countries across Europe COMPOSITE will improve the planning and execution of change initiatives in the police, show how these projects can be better aligned with the cultural and societal context per country and explain how the negative process effects can be mitigated. A further aim is to improve both the individual police organization per country and joint European capabilities. The project delivers: 1.A comparative strategic analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for police organizations in 10 European countries and best practices to meet current and future challenges. 2.A comparative analysis of planning and execution of the change processes, focusing on the impact of leadership, professional and organizational identities and societal expectations. 3.A toolbox containing instruments for training and consultancy and the Annual European Police force monitor to plan and execute changes responding to known and yet unknown challenges and opportunities. The consortium contains universities, business schools, police academies, a technological research institute and consultancy firms.

Preparing essential parts of the healthcare system such as hospitals and their partners to prevent, respond, and rapidly recover from these threats is critical for protecting and securing the entire health infrastructure. Large-scale disaster situations causing mass casualty incidents are characterised by large numbers of same-type injuries which require immediate and simultaneous medical intervention and means of support such as ambulances, surgeries, specialists, diagnostic equipment and others.\nThese characteristics underline the need for enhanced communication between medical institutions and other organisations involved in disaster management. At the same time, the surge of demand for services to patients points to the need for better organisation within hospitals concerning the deployment of specialists and the availability of medical supplies, transportation, rooms and equipment.\n\nWhile a variety of incidents may necessitate an emergency response, different types of such incidents (natural disasters, explosions, humanitarian crises and others) mean a different framework for responders. While health responders are ubiquitous in their involvement with the response to an emergency situation, the parameters regarding how they are involved greatly differ with the type of threat represented.\n\nThe COncORDE project will develop a Decision Support System (DSS) to improve preparedness and interoperability of medical services during an emergency which affects the health of the population at local, regional or cross-border level.

In recent decades, the number of threats to aviation security has grown significantly, especially after 9/11. This has led to ever more security regulations as the threats evolve. Security procedures have become exceedingly complex and invasive to passenger privacy; the number of security measures as well as personnel and therefore costs are growing steadily.\nAt the same time passenger and cargo traffic are expected to double in the next 15 years. Already today, security is one of the main reasons for delayed take-off. It is clear that the current complex security system cannot be adapted to such a growth without a large rise in costs. It has already and will increasingly become a major market restraint.\nTherefore, the proposed project COPRA aims to answer two questions:\n•\tHow does the threat situation in civil aviation evolve in the future, taking into account both existing and new technologies and their continuing development and proliferation?\n•\tWhich opportunities arise from the development and proliferation of new technologies and security procedures to overcome the current complex and expensive security situation and to enable sustainable growth for the future?\nCOPRA’s main objective is to answer both questions in a way that will constitute the optimal balance between security, privacy, public acceptability, mobility and costs, while providing ideas on how to increase flexibility and resilience of the whole aviation system against threats.\nTo that aim COPRA brings together a well balanced consortium of research organisations, industry and major air transport providers with a wide range of European stakeholders. End-users, technology providers, policy makers and think tanks will be involved in COPRA through the formation of expert groups.

We will develop scenarios that consider possibilities for their use in crisis situations by the public, officials and first responders. We will examine the role of citizens as first responders, social activists and citizen journalists in new media communication, and the ethical issues and political consequences of citizen participation. The project will result in a set of guidelines for citizens, government authorities, first responders and industry for the most effective use of ICTs to aid citizen security during crises.\nCOSMIC threads stakeholder engagement throughout the project and the information from work packages two through four will be validated using stakeholder engagement workshops and a web platform of international first response organisations. We intend for these to form a breeding ground for future activities and efforts in the use of new and emerging ICTs in crises.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management;/social sciences/law;/social sciences/media and communications/journalism","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312737","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"108073","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"997040.2","startDate":"2013-04-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},
{"id":"123","name":"COUNTERCRAFT - Intelligence campaigns in the digital realms","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"Many large companies are subject to advanced directed attacks performed by the competence, governments, organized crime bands, a malicious employee, etc. interested in damaging the company subject of the attack for different reasons. Cyber criminals grow more sophisticated by the day, and network security architectures are quickly evolving in an attempt to keep up. Despite recent advances, sophisticated malware authors and cyber criminals are innovating at a faster pace than security professionals can react to. Attackers are increasingly able to slip past network security applications such as IDSs, IPSs, next-gen firewalls, and web application firewalls – regardless of how new and comprehensive they are. Thus, companies can no longer afford to concentrate all of their resources on firewalls and first line of defense systems. They also need to incorporate “internally focused” solutions such as deception technologies to help identify a criminal while in attack mode; a criminal that has already bypassed the current state-of-the-art perimeter defenses. The project aims to accelerate the introduction of the first EU deception tool capable of detecting advanced targeted cyber-attacks, obstructing the actions of attackers and obtaining the maximum amount of information from them by successfully designing, deploying, monitoring and managing Counter Intelligence Campaigns. COUNTERCRAFT will allow: To reduce the overall cost of cyberattacks by 50%; to shorten the average computer infection period by 70% from 300 days to 90 days; to reduce the time needed to effectively design, deploy, monitor and manage counter intelligence campaigns by 80% from 4 hours/day to 48 minutes/day; to reduce the tendency of COUNTERCRAFT users to be attacked by 60%; to identify the intentions of the attacker; to leverage “intelligence” information about the attacks to create and distribute indicators of compromise (IOCs); to orchestrate the cyber-security strategy .","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/network security;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/malicious software","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/767383","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"211589","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"1133562.5","startDate":"2017-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"124","name":"COUNTERFOG - DEVICE FOR LARGE SCALE FOG DECONTAMINATION","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"COUNTERFOG will be a new, rapid response system for collapsing all kinds of dispersed agents (smoke, fog, spores, etc.) by using a fog made of a solution that could eventually contain any kind of neutralizing component. It will be a permanent installation in large public buildings like railway stations but also a portable COUNTERFOG for use outdoors, used to counteract a CBRN attack in its earliest stages, greatly reducing the number of potential fatalities.  In fact, COUNTERFOG will use the same “weapon” as a CBRN attack: a dispersed state with a large surface/volume ratio. It will penetrate all the intricate holes CBRN agents are able to infiltrate. As it needs a minimum quantity of decontaminant, it is intrinsically an environmental-friendly and electric-compatible system. It would have three benefits: Firstly, to neutralize and collapse the CBRN cloud, secondly, to rapidly decontaminate all the affected people in that area, and finally, to rapidly decontaminate any equipment and the facility itself.\nBecause of the large-scale fogging capacity of up to three components, choice of pressures and capability to simultaneously emulsify liquids and disperse solid particles and an enormous surface/volume ratio, it will be possible to counteract a CBRN cloud in large, open areas.  Nozzle, sensor and solid mesoporous particles will be technological keys.\nA Fog Dynamic Laboratory will be designed, built and used in the project to test the ability such a system has to condense different kinds of smokes, clouds or fogs and its ability to simultaneously neutralize different kinds of CBRN agents and combined incidents (fire & CBRN). Full scale tests will be also performed. Eventually, the real applicability, side effects and compatibility with conventional fire protection facilities will also investigated, a detailed marketing plan prepared and a diffusion campaign implemented.  Furthermore, a spin-off company will be set up in order to exploit the results most effectively.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/physical sciences/theoretical physics/particles","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312804","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"110930","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"3471992.7","startDate":"2013-11-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. \nThe goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes. The use of sophisticated proxy cryptography schemes will enable a secure and privacy preserving information sharing network for cloud-based identity information in which even the identity provider cannot access the data in plain-text and hence protect access to identity data. We focus not only on evaluating and applying novel crypto-approaches for IAMs but also on implementing them in an easy-to-use way to motivate secure handling of identity data. \nIn order to also address security, privacy and trust issues related to the used cloud platforms and services we will investigate assurance and resilience approaches for enhancing underlying cloud services. To empirically evaluate our work and to produce outputs of a high technical readiness we will consider use cases from all three domains mentioned above.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/medical and health sciences/health sciences/health care services/ehealth;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653454","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194869","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"5978082.5","startDate":"2015-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The recent discovery of a malware called Stuxnet, show that these threats are already a reality. Their success in infiltrating Critical Infrastructure environments is calling attention on the ineffectiveness of standard security mechanisms at detecting them. Stuxnet is believed to have been operating undetected for almost one year leveraging multiple vulnerabilities that were previously unknown, and has been discovered only as a consequence to an operational anomaly that triggered the attention of the field operators. This fact clearly shows that our methods to find vulnerabilities and detect ongoing or successful attacks in critical infrastructure environments are not sufficient.\n\nCRISALIS focuses on these two aspects: detection of vulnerabilities and attacks in critical infrastructure environments. We focus on two different, yet interlinked, use cases that are typical for the power grid infrastructure: control systems based on SCADA protocols and the Advanced Metering Infrastructure. CRISALIS leverages the unique characteristics of critical infrastructure environments to produce novel practical mechanisms and techniques for their security assessment and protection. This is achieved by pursuing three main research objectives: (i) providing new methodologies and techniques to secure critical infrastructure systems; (ii) providing new tools to detect intrusions; (iii) developing new, more effective, techniques to analyze infected systems. Particular attention is paid to ensure the practical implementation of these techniques in real-world environments, and to minimize the impact on operations, goals which are attainable thanks to the direct involvement in the process of end users and device manufacturers who provide expertise and realistic test environments to validate the proposed methodologies.'","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/malicious software;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electrical engineering/power engineering/electric power transmission","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285477","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"103538","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"3426387.79","startDate":"2012-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Reaching beyond the technology focused boundaries of classical information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity includes organizational and behavioural aspects of IT systems and also needs to comply to the currently actively developing legal and regulatory framework for cybersecurity. For example, the European Union recently passed the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive that obliges member states to get in line with the EU strategy. While large corporations might have the resources to follow those developments and bring their IT infrastructure and services in line with the requirements, the burden for smaller organizations like local public administration will be substantial and the required resources might not be available.\nNew and innovative solutions that will help local public administration to ease the burden of being in line with cybersecurity requirements are needed. For example, cooperation and coordination is one of the major aspects of the NIS and EU cybersecurity strategy. An enabling technology for cooperation and coordination is cyber situational awareness and information sharing of cyber incidents. In this project we propose a cybersecurity situational awareness solution for local public administrations that, based on an analysis of the context provides automatic incident detection and visualization, and enables information exchange with relevant national and EU level NIS authorities like CERTs. Advanced features like system self-healing based on the situational awareness technologies, and multi-lingual semantics support to account for language barriers in the EU context, are part of the solution.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/big data;/social sciences/political science/public administration;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/data analysis","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/740723","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"210224","payments":"16","beneficiaries":"16","total_amount":"3728603.75","startDate":"2017-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

By ‘culture’ we mean more than ethnicity, important though that is; we also refer to social class, vulnerability, age, gender, disability and migration status. Cultures of Recovery and Resilience among children and young people in Disasters (CUiDAR) will address the exclusion of children and young people from the disaster planning and management process; it will provide innovative and creative communication channels for children’s voices to be heard and it will develop a child centred disasters management framework for use by policy/decision makers in participating countries, the EU and beyond. To achieve the objectives we have designed a suite of activities: scoping; dialogues with children (consultative workshops); regional level mutual learning exercises; national level awareness and communication events; framework design/building, and an in-depth ongoing approach to dissemination. Our unique partnership with the major children’s charity Save the Children enables the Consortium to work closely with children to achieve our objectives. Our strong existing links with emergency planners and authorities enables us to access key audiences.

Known techniques, as fluorescence will be improved by mean of novel proteins, as antibodies to extend Probability of Detection (PoD). The techniques are: 1. A low cost, high data throughput sensing technique, based on UV-Vis-NIR fluorescence. Fluorescence will be enhanced by development of Organic macro-molecules sensitive to specific classes of compounds of interest (ephedrine, pseudoephedryne, P2P, …) in the domain of drug detection. The fluorescence analysis will be based on an ‘opto-chip’ which can incorporate an array of different properly engineered fluorescent chemical protein able to bind to the analytes with an ‘immuno-type’ reaction. An array of classes of compounds can be thus very fast discriminated by one-shot measurement. 2. A high sensitivity and selectivity, but compact and low weight, spectroscopic sensing technique in MIR–IR optical range, based on Laser PhotoAcoustic Sensor (LPAS). Detection of drug precursors based on spectroscopic techniques can guarantee a good selectivity, a low Probability of False Alarm and a suitable operation speed. The size of the photo-acoustic cell can be made as small as possible for a compact sensor and, depending on the performances, it can cost down to 1000€.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/biological sciences/biochemistry/biomolecules/proteins;/natural sciences/physical sciences/optics/laser physics","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242387","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"94695","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"3486406.0","startDate":"2010-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-11-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

So far, most solutions are partial and unsatisfying, and limited to Corporate IT cyber-solutions, e.g. firewalls, authentication, defense in depth. The present project proposes the development of a new protection system called CYPRES.\nThe proposed CYPRES is one of the first products able to protect specifically industrial automation systems. It uses Artificial Intelligence combined with the real condition of the process to detect discrepancies that reveal intrusions or attacks, even as slow or small as a malware can be. To perform well, CYPRES must be engineered for each type of process. \nThe development comprises design specifications and development of the CYPRES core-product subsequent to a thorough market study followed by a commercial product specific to Electricity networks protection, then another for Water and wastewater systems. Further processes will be developed later on.

This will enable high throughput screening of soft targets such as vehicles, people and their personal effects.  \n\nThe technology is based on a linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometer (MS) operating in a non-scanning mode. A non-scanning LIT allows selective ion monitoring of target threat molecules using optimal voltages for each ion mass without performing a full mass spectral scan. This result is higher sensitivity, simpler control electronics, smaller size, lower power consumption and cost. The limits of detection of LIT-MS instrument are in low parts per billion (ppb) with parts per trillion (ppt) levels achievable with suitable analyte enrichment provided by a pre-concentrator. Once the MS fingerprint of an unknown substance is measured, it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. \n\nIn 2014 pre-prototype instrument was demonstrated in FP7 Project SNIFFLES. ChemSniff will develop a more compact MS-based than existing instruments on the market with extra capability for rapid scans of solid surfaces using suitable atmospheric ionisation inlet.  Methods for miniaturisation will be applied to all key components including the vacuum system, which is the most robust part. This will be done through improved designs based on results from numerical modelling, operational designs, novel low-cost 3D printing manufacturing, electronics simplification and vacuum system optimisation. \n\nThe final instrument will allow reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility. Performance will be benchmarked against a state-of-the-art conventional MS system for in-field analysis The project outcome will be an automated portable MS-based sniffer device, tested and evaluated for a range of security applications and markets by end-users.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/674716","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"198741","payments":"2","beneficiaries":"2","total_amount":"1577030.0","startDate":"2015-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The emerging notion of multimodality supports a plethora of diverse transport services, typically offered from a central location. There however, the complex interconnected infrastructures ease the cyber-threats propagation while the underlying mosaic of fleets, personal hand-held devices and non-standardized data types increase the system's attack surface and require the authorities collaboration to proactively handle severe incidents.\nCitySCAPE leverages the skills and mature technology of its 15-partner consortium to systematically explore all different cybersecurity dimensions of multimodal transport. These dimensions will drive a characterization of the cyber-threats in the ICT multimodal transport, extended to the close-by power and financial sector. Innovative software tools will be introduced to estimate the threats propagation in the system. Then, CitySCAPE will realize a modular software toolkit enabled to be seamlessly integrated into any multimodal transport system to: a)detect suspicious traffic-data values and identify persistent threats; b)evaluate an attack's impact in technical and notably in financial terms; c)combine external knowledge and internally-observed activities to enhance the predictability of zero-day attacks; d)instantiate a networked overlay to circulate informative notifications to CERT authorities and support their interplay. The CitySCAPE solution will be tested over a timely set of use-cases involving ticketing applications, cyber-fraud and location data in the regional transport system of two European cities, where extensive experiments will showcase its effectiveness. The findings will steer training sessions of expert/non-expert audience and shape a strong standardization contribution to security (labelling) protocols.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883321","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"228798","payments":"15","beneficiaries":"15","total_amount":"4998057.88","startDate":"2020-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2023-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},
{"id":"153","name":"CockpitCI - Cybersecurity on SCADA: risk prediction, analysis and reaction tools for Critical Infrastructures","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"The protection of the national infrastructures is one of the main issues for national and international security. While FP7 MICIE project has proved that increasing cooperation among infrastructures increases their level of service and predictive capability, it is not enough to effectively counteract threats such as cyber attacks. Such attacks could be performed blocking communication from central SCADA to local equipments or inserting fake commands/measurements in the SCADA-field equipment communications (as happened with STUXNET worm). The paradox is that critical infrastructures massively rely on the newest interconnected (and vulnerable) ICT technologies, while the control equipment is typically old, legacy software/hardware. Such a combination of factors may lead to very dangerous situations, exposing systems to a wide variety of attacks. To overcome such threats, the CockpitCI project aims on one hand to continue the work done in MICIE by refining and updating the on-line Risk Predictor deployed in the SCADA centre, on the other hand to provide some kind of intelligence to field equipment, allowing them to perform local decisions in order to self-identify and self-react to abnormal situations induced by cyber attacks. It is mandatory to operate both at SCADA control centre and at field equipment because it is very dangerous to let field components operate autonomously. To address this issue an hybrid validation system will be implemented: at the Control Centre level an “Integrated On-line Risk Predictor” will provide the operator with qualitative/quantitative measurements of near future level of risk integrating data coming from the field, from other infrastructures, and from smart detection agents monitoring possible cyber attacks; at field level, the system is complemented with a smart software layer for field equipment and a detection system for the TLC network. The system will be validated on real equipment and scenarios provided by Israel Electric Corp.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285647","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102078","payments":"14","beneficiaries":"14","total_amount":"2986675.0","startDate":"2012-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Estimates of global financial losses due to cyber-crime are at least €350 billion per year and are expected to reach €1.89 trillion by 2019. Cyber-crime has led to the loss of up to 150,000 jobs in Europe, which is about 0.6% of the total unemployed population. In response to cyber-crime, we initiated ‘ConnectProtect’ in 2012, a total cyber protection service for SMEs and residential customers.\n\nWe worked with about 20 SMEs in the UK to build this service and up to date, we developed a reporting engine capable of correlating events/logs from multiple security products across multiple organisations and constantly updating each event in real-time to generate the relevant classification of potential threat. The report engine is able to generate a case for our engineers to deal with an incident in real-time and allowing the customer to view their security state via a dashboard. We aim to further establish and understand our target market and conduct a detailed Europe wide cyber-security market study to establish the size and dynamics of the small business market; engage developmental, operational, and marketing partners for successful delivery of this project.\n\nWe also seek to develop an Intellectual Property (IP) strategy to protect our solution from exploitation by other parties. Through this project we will reduce the cyber security burden in the EU from an average of €280 to between €10 and €70 per employee per month and we will create over 100 jobs through native sales language teams that would be set up in our various target countries.

Recent initiatives to upgrade power systems into smart grids target an even tighter integration with information technologies to enable the integration of renewable energy sources, local and bulk generation and demand response. To fully estimate the security of an enterprise’s system architecture, a large number of issues must be considered. Enterprise systems security managers must be able to assess how vulnerabilities in one system influence vulnerabilities in other systems. In addition, security managers must be able to assess how individual vulnerabilities influence the security of the entire system of systems, given the protection solutions that are used in different locations in the architecture.

{"id":"163","name":"DAPS - Drone Alarm and Protection System","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"Drones are moving from being mainly a military technology to a mass market gadget. Whereas demand and applications for drones are fast-growing, the drone market is also raising security and privacy issues. Presently, there are obvious concerns about the possibility of using drones for terrorist attacks in which drones could be equipped with explosives and biological weapons. The development of new and efficient tools able to detect and jam civilian drones used for illegal proposes has become a priority in the security field.\nMyDefence aims to pursue a major market opportunity through the development of an innovative drone alarm and protection system (DAPS) to be used by security services providers and critical infrastructure owners - public and private sectors - in urban contexts.\nDAPS is a scalable, networked system with hardware and embedded software algorithms coupled to a graphical user interface. DAPS is able to detect and identify illegal drones around secure areas and to jam the device in a specific wireless frequency range without interfering with other mobile signals and forcing a controlled drone landing.\nWhereas the core technology is already demonstrated in an operational environment, the further maturation of the concept into a fully commercial and scalable solution is hampered due to the existence of technical and non-technical barriers. Therefore, there is a need to further establish market and regulatory feasibility of the proposed DAPS concept. Also, demonstrate and validate both the technical and economic viability of DAPS at the level of different security applications.\nInitially, this will require a Phase 1 feasibility study that will give us a clear direction for our demonstration and market replication strategies. If objectives for phases 1 and 2 are successfully achieved, it will represent a significant business opportunity, with an expected sales turnover of €73 million and profits reaching €60.5 million, 6 years after commercialization.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/robotics/autonomous robots/drones","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/719382","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"201773","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2016-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-05-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Their use in Search and Rescue operations can now be envisaged to enhance first responder capabilities and intervene in hazardous areas. For cost and procedural reasons however, the market is still very fragmented and business models are unclear.\nThe DARIUS project will leverage previous R&D efforts on technologies and possible added-value of these systems for situation awareness to envisage their adaptation and integration in complex multi-national/agency SAR operations. The main objective of DARIUS is to reach effective levels of interoperability so these systems can be shared between several organisations. This objective will be achieved in designing a Generic Ground Station with associated proposed standards, a full integration in the command and control cycle and a consistent communication network. In addition, DARIUS will adapt the existing unmanned systems and their payloads (air, ground and maritime) to the specificities of the Search and Rescue missions. DARIUS solutions will be evaluated in real conditions through 3 scenarios (Urban, forest fires and maritime SAR) designed by the end-users.\nThe project will be implemented under the control of a wide panel of fully committed end-users. It will be performed following an optimised structure and with flexible and proven procedures.\nThe DARIUS consortium encompasses several end-users, major players in the domain of C4I and large system integration, unmanned system solution providers, SMEs that will bring innovative solutions and support the integration and RTOs that will further develop novel technologies.\nThe expected impact from DARIUS is the better integration of the systems in real operations and in enhancing the safety of citizens.

The malicious threats, particularly those posed by terrorists, require a comprehensive approach: if security improvements are patchy, perpetrators are likely to find the loopholes left. With their open access points and interconnections, surface mass transportation systems are highly vulnerable, while it is technically and economically, impossible for the multiple operators to employ security measures similar to those used at airports.   With eight technology and security analysis RTOs, four transportation industries and system integrators and two transportation consultancies – many with previous experience of working together in projects like SeNTRE and STACCATO – DEMASST is exceptionally well prepared to take on the dual challenges of analysis and networking necessary to define and achieve commitment for the strategic roadmap for the Phase 2 Demonstration project.   DEMASST will develop a highly structured approach to the demonstration programme built on identifying the main security gaps and the most promising integrated solutions, utilising sufficiently mature technologies, for filling them. In the type of Concept Development & Experimentation approach proposed the experiments must be designed and analysed so as to be maximally informative. Given the vast variation in mass transportation systems an effective demonstration programme must also identify synergies between demo tasks and use less costly methods than full scale demonstration whenever that helps a broader awareness. DEMASST proposes to build the methodological infrastructure for this. But an optimal demo project design does not stop with finding scientific answers: the issue of turning demonstration into innovation is top on DEMASST’s agenda.

The DIRAC sensor will be developed to: 1) be used on the field primarily by customs officers for controls at the EU external frontiers and by law enforcement personnel for intra-Community checks as a rugged and hand-portable unit; 2) perform rapid detection of key chemicals; 3) reject interferents with minimal false positive alarm rate; 4) perform advanced data analyses such as similarity evaluation between the chemical structure of the unknown sample with that of controlled/illicit substances. Currently, GC-IRAS (through FTIR implementation) is, together with GC-MS (Mass Spectrometry), the most powerful technique for the identification and quantification of amphetamines. However, so far GC-IRAS has been implemented only as bench-top instrumentation for forensic applications and bulk analysis down to milli- and micro-gram quantities. In DIRAC, the use of silicon-micromachined GC columns, solid state lasers, and hollow fibres IR, will allow to develop a GC-IRAS sensor that features hand-portability and prompt response –for field operation– and is capable to perform both bulk analysis and trace analysis with nano-gram sensitivity. The DIRAC sensor will further feature a) an advanced sampling device, that separates the analyte from larger amounts of interfering materials (dust, skin particles) by electrostatic charging; and, b), an advanced silicon micro-machined pre-concentration device, capable to treat sequentially both volatile ATS substances and non volatile ammonium salts of the amphetamines. The main output of the DIRAC project will be a fully functional sensor prototype from sampling to read out.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/chemical sciences/analytical chemistry/spectroscopy;/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas;/natural sciences/chemical sciences/inorganic chemistry/inorganic compounds;/social sciences/law;/natural sciences/physical sciences/theoretical physics/particles;/natural sciences/chemical sciences/analytical chemistry/mass spectrometry;/natural sciences/physical sciences/optics/laser physics","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242309","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"94693","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"2985507.72","startDate":"2010-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Misunderstandings between first responders makes decision-making slower and more difficult. However, spread and development of networks and Emergency Management Systems (EMS) has improved emergency responses, becoming more coordinated. Despite improvements made in recent years, EMS have not still solved problems related to cultural, legal and linguistic differences which are the real cause of slower decision-making. In addition, from a technical perspective, the consolidation of current EMS and the limitations of their exchanged data formats offers another problem to be solved in any solution proposed for information interoperability between heterogeneous EMS surrounded by different contexts.\nTo overcome this problem, a two step solution is proposed: (i) As main objective and foundations of this proposal, the development of a common and modular ontology shared by all the stakeholders offers the best solution to gather all stakeholders knowledge in a unique and flexible data model, taking into account different countries cultural, linguistic and legal issues (ii) Taking advantage of  the fact that most legacy Emergency Management Systems are based on Service-Oriented-Architectures (SOA), i.e. they collect information from services offered by other systems (e.g. Geographic Information Systems), the interoperability burden will be addressed by means of transparent SOA mediation algorithms compliant with current data formats and existing solutions.\nTaking into account the heterogeneity and diversity of all existing scenarios in crisis episodes, the potential results of this proposed ontology-based interoperability solution will be validated through the design and development of a realistic prototype scenario actively involving both emergency managers and emergency first responders.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/humanities/philosophy, ethics and religion/philosophy/metaphysics/ontology;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/physical geography/cartography/geographic information systems","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285069","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102279","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"2783970.0","startDate":"2012-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The curriculum will tackle dynamic challenges facing disaster incident managers in order to enhance the efficiency, efficacy, coordination, coherence and appropriateness of their response efforts. These skills are crucial because of an alarming increase in the frequency, intensity and complexity of disasters while governments are simultaneously facing budgetary constraints on humanitarian aid due to overwhelming sovereign debt.\n\nThis curriculum aims to establish a standard practice among European disaster and crisis managers in order to pool resources and expertise by cultivating a network of dedicated professionals that think alike and can communicate beyond obscure bureaucratic structures. Educational integration of crisis managers from national, regional and international authorities, NGO's and existing training institutions from around the world leads to a more concerted effort in disaster response.\n\nThe curriculum will fulfill EU criteria on crisis management but will also have a global outreach since the EU is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to developing countries. This satisfies the moral obligations the EU feels toward less fortunate nations and gives European crises managers an unbridled opportunity to gain hands-on experience in disaster stricken zones around the world.

DITSEF aims at increasing the effectiveness and safety of First Responders by optimal information gathering and sharing with their higher command levels. DITSEF will provide: - Self organising robust ad-hoc communications where the existing infrastructure may be compromised, allowing communication between the First Responders and between them and their command level. - Accurate novel 3D positioning in indoor environments. - Sensors that offer a reliable overview of the situation and of the potential threats (explosives, chemicals, fire, etc.) - Enhanced vision for the FR in visually -impaired conditions, trough ingenious and unprecented HMIs consisting of sensors-based visual elements, showing spatial features and thermal imagery overlaid on the direct perception of the First Responder. The operational value of the integrated solution will be demonstrated through users defined scenarios in a real operational environment. it will incorporate end-users from both the Critical Infrastructures' domain and the First Responders' domain. Five dedicated workshops will allow the collection of users requirements, operational scenarios and allow the cross-fertilisation of information on operations and procedures of players from different states and  domains; they will create awareness on project results and prepare their take-up.

The DNA TRUSTAG platform enables cost-effective and scalable production of composite nanoparticles containing unique DNA codes (impossible to forge), which generate reading signals similar to a barcoded label. The composite nanoparticles are used to mark and authenticate raw materials and a range of products directly in the production line.\nThe introduction of counterfeit goods in distribution chains is reaching epidemic proportions. Counterfeit goods now encompass all industrial sectors, including pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, cosmetics, automotive spare parts, pesticides, food and beverages. Counterfeit products are becoming more refined and there is an increasing number of cases, where not even manufacturers are able to distinguish fake from original.\nTraditional, anti-counterfeit technologies based on physical methods, such as holograms, security inks and labels, barcodes and radio-frequency identification are vulnerable, thus being frequently counterfeited. Clearly, there is a market opportunity for new and innovative anti-counterfeit technologies.\nWe aim to explore and assess the feasibility of our technology under industrial conditions (e.g., during the production of authentication labels and tests) and to study the feasibility of the introduction of DNA TRUSTAG technology (product and services) in the international market. To this end, both the technical and economic viability of the project will be accessed in collaboration with important players in the sector.

The underlying concept of DOGANA is that Social Vulnerabilities Assessments (SVAs), when regularly performed with the help of an efficient framework, help deploy effective mitigation strategies and lead to reducing the risk created by modern Social Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. Two relevant features of the proposed framework are: i) the presence of the 'awareness' component within the framework as the cornerstone of the mitigation activities; ii) the legal compliance by design of the whole framework, that will be ensured by a partner and a  work package explicitly devoted to this task. Moreover, the outcomes of the project are also expected to provide a solid basis to revise the insurance models for cyber-attacks related risks, thanks to the involvement of 2 strong DOGANA partners in this area of activity.  \nThe project will be implemented by a consortium of 18 partners, from 11 different countries, including users, technology providers of whom 3 are major world-wide cyber-security solutions market leaders as well as legal and psychological expertise.

{"id":"183","name":"DRIVER+ - DRiving InnoVation in crisis management for European Resilience","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"DRIVER\\ starts from the experience that neither successful R&D nor strong end-user demand always lead to innovation in the Crisis Management (CM) domain. This is a problem since as societies become more complex, increasing scope and unpredictability of potential crises and faster dynamics of major incidents put increasingly stringent demands on CM. European CM capabilities already constitute a mature System of Systems; hence wholesale redesign would often be too costly and might critically destabilise existing CM capabilities. Therefore DRIVER\\ focuses on augmenting rather than replacing existing capabilities. DRIVER\\ has three main objectives: 1) Develop a pan-European Test-bed for crisis management capability development; 2) Develop a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of crisis management solutions, and 3) Facilitate a shared understanding of crisis management across Europe.\n\nThe DRIVER\\ Test-bed will provide the technological infrastructure, the necessary supporting methodology and adequate support tools. The Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) is a database driven web site that documents all the available DRIVER\\ solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the trials. Initially, the PoS will contain information about the solutions that are already available within the consortium; the PoS will be extended with third-party solutions when required by the trials, and ultimately opened up for any external organisation to share data and experiences on solutions.\n\nA series of trials will be conducted during which solutions will be operationalised and tested. All results of the trials will be stored and made available in the PoS. Several I4CM events will be organized as well as a final conference. In addition to this, a firm link is established and will be maintained with DG HOME’s “Community of Users on Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies” and other European stakeholder groups and relevant initiatives, for instance on standardization.\n\nTo maximise impact beyond the scope of the project and of the DRIVER\\ consortium it is necessary to develop the sustainability of the European Test-bed, the exploitation of the DRIVER Portfolio of Solutions and to promote a European CM community, which shares a common CM understanding and is increasingly willing to share capabilities and collaborate in CM innovation. Together this will boost Europe’s ability to continue adapting to new threats and emerging needs, laying the basis for a continuously resilient EU and providing a mechanism to drive innovation in European CM by bridging the gap from practitioners need and R&D to the market.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management;/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607798","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"188608","payments":"43","beneficiaries":"42","total_amount":"35253929.0","startDate":"2014-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Lack of co-ordination in law enforcement and legislation, lack of common consensus on the nature of cyber crime and lack of knowledge sharing and trust are just some of the issues that both afflict cyber crime responses and cloud our understanding of cyber crime. E-CRIME addresses these well-known problems, while analysing the economic impact of cyber crime and developing concrete measures to manage risks and deter cyber criminals in non-ICT sectors. E-CRIME does so by adopting an interdisciplinary and multi-level-stakeholder focused approach that fully integrates a wide range of stakeholders’ knowledge and insights into the project. First, the project will create a detailed taxonomy and inventory of cyber crime in non-ICT sectors and analyse cyber criminal structures and economies by combining the best existing data sources with specialist new insights from key stakeholders and experts. Second, E-CRIME will assess existing counter-measures against cyber crime in non-ICT sectors in the form of current technology, best practices, policy and enforcement approaches, and awareness and trust initiatives. Third, having mapped the as-is of cyber crime, the project will use available information and new data to develop a multi-level model to measure the economic impact of cyber crime on non ICT-sectors. Fourth, E-CRIME will integrate all its previous findings to identify and develop diverse, concrete counter-measures, combined in portfolios of inter-sector and intra-sector solutions, including enhancement for crime-proofed applications, risk management tools, policy and best practices, and trust and confidence measures. The analysis will proceed in close co-operation with relevant and diverse stakeholders.

Currently, distributors and governments are suffering important financial losses due to theft, smuggling, and fraud in the delivery and sale of oil and gas products, costing European companies an estimated range from 100€ million to 1,300€ million  every year.  \nIn WACnGO, our activity started in 2008 with the development of a powerful system to provide an integral logistics management solution to the liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) and oil distribution companies, based on software (SW) tools and hardware (HW) devices to control, maintain and optimize the logistics and operation of this industry. In WACnGO we are focusing on this market segment through the offering of innovative solutions and by being adaptive to customer needs. \nAs one of the major issues to be tackled by oil/gas distribution companies is the prevention of the theft and fraud associated with the distribution of their products. We propose to prevent illegal practices and their direct economic consequences with an innovative security solution for oil/LPG tanks: the e-LockS solution. It is an integrated  SW and HW architecture system based on two main components:\n- Caplock®: cap with the electronic lock integrated to be installed in each tank. \n- e-key®: intelligent key which will be managed from the Oil/LPG distribution management system (assignment of the permission to open a single tank and/or group of tanks).","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas;/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/petroleum;/natural sciences/chemical sciences/organic chemistry/hydrocarbons","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/673413","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"197956","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2015-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

This information will enable improved control and management, resulting in real time synchronization between forces on the ground (police, rescue, firefighters) and out-of-theater command and control centers (CC). The approach guiding the E-SPONDER project is based on the fusion of variable forms of field-derived data within a central system which will then provide information analysis and decision support applications at designated CC locations in order to provide in situ support to first responders that operate in Critical Infrastructures. Statistics show that efficient emergency system can reduce accident losses to 6%, compared with situations without emergency system . As a result, an efficient emergency system is a key to cope with all kinds of sudden events and improve safety of cities and countries. To do this, E-SPONDER will achieve the following objectives: i) Improvement of front end data collection technologies installed both on portable and fixed platforms, providing a flexible yet comprehensive coverage of the affected area; ii) this data will then be fused and analyzed to provide real-time decision support; iii) E-SPONDER will make these resources readily available to commanders through the use of easily accessible web-portals but lastly and most important it will provide significant support based on Information and Communication Technologies to the First Responders. Thus, E-SPONDER will minimize the uncertainty that characterizes crisis events, thereby limiting their scope. Once E-SPONDER elements are ready for deployment they will be integrated and extensively field tested.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242411","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"94833","payments":"17","beneficiaries":"17","total_amount":"8790044.0","startDate":"2010-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

An approach is required which really integrates functionalities across all these levels. Cooperation of privately operated CIs and public bodies (governments and EU) is difficult but mandatory. After about 10 years of analysis and research on partial effects in CIP and for individual infrastructure sectors, ECOSSIAN is supposed to be the first attempt to develop this holistic system in the sense portrayed above. A prototype system will be developed which facilitates preventive functions like threat monitoring, early indicator and real threat detection, alerting, support of threat mitigation and disaster management. In the technical architecture with an operations centre and the interfaces to legacy systems (e.g., SCADA), advanced technologies need to be integrated, including fast data aggregation and fusion, visualization of the situation, planning and decision support, and flexible networks for information sharing and coordination support, and the connection of local operations centres. This system will only be successful, if the technical solutions will be complemented by an effective and agreed organizational concept and the implementation of novel rules and regulations. And finally, the large spectrum of economically intangible factors will have significant influence on the quality and acceptance of the system. These factors of societal perception and appreciation, the existing and required legal framework, questions of information security and implications on privacy will be analyzed, assessed and regarded in the concept. The system will be tested, demonstrated and evaluated in realistic use cases.

Whenever and wherever they occur, they usually require a gradual and multi-facetted response as they tend to provoke severe and unexpected physical, psychological, societal, economical and political effects that cross EU-borders. Successful CBRNE resilience requires a global System-of-Systems approach. The EDEN project will leverage the added-value of tools and systems from previous R&D efforts and improve CBRNE resilience through their adaptation and integration. The concept of the EDEN project is to provide a “toolbox of toolboxes” EDEN Store to give stakeholders access to interoperable capabilities they deem important, or affordable, from a certified set of applications. It will share the burden of development and allows for lessons to be learned and applications to be enhanced. The benefit of the EDEN concept is that integration will be applied at the application level.  This means that all countries and stakeholders, irrespective of their existing capability levels, will gain immediate advantages through improved interoperability.  EDEN Store will allow capabilities to be shared among multi-national CBRNE stakeholders, which is paramount in cross-border incident management, and through time allow for a build up of common capability across European boundaries. EDEN will be validated by three themed end-user demonstrations (Food Industry, Multi Chemical, Radiological) covering multiple hazards (CBRNE), phases of the security cycle, response tiers, and stakeholders. The EDEN consortium includes CBRNE domain end-users, major stakeholders, large system integration and solution providers, including SMEs with innovative solutions, and RTOs. The impact of EDEN is to provide affordable CBRNE resilience and market sustainability through the better integration of systems in real operations and thus enhancing the safety of citizens.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/313077","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"110015","payments":"38","beneficiaries":"38","total_amount":"24766823.46","startDate":"2013-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

It is our contention that disaster risk reduction policies and practices are intrinsically cultural as they emerge from and are therefore largely shaped by the interplay of cultures prevalent at both the community, organisational and institutional level. Therefore any endeavour aimed at improving disaster risk reduction efforts should be founded on a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of this interplay and more importantly of the influential role of culture on the way people prepare for, experience, respond, and recover from disasters. EDUCEN will achieve its objectives this by firstly allowing knowledge and understanding of culture(s) in light of disaster risk reduction to become accessible to relevant stakeholders and secondly by encouraging, enabling and sustaining multi-stakeholder dialogue through which academics, practitioners and communities can actively engage and share knowledge, expertise and experiences which will enable all to strengthen their capabilities and impact, but most importantly will allow for both formal and informal risk managers and planners and spatial planners emergency responders in cities to be better informed and guided.

{"id":"195","name":"EFFISEC - Efficient Integrated Security Checkpoints","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"Illegal immigration and illicit material detection is a growing concern at the European borders; in that respect border security checkpoints must be particularly efficient against any kind of threat. If airport checkpoints controls are today technically improving, land and seaport checkpoints differ strongly from airports ones and are more complex to process. During the last years, most of the efforts were devoted to develop new solutions addressing new security challenges in airports. We can expect that very shortly authorities will have to guarantee the same level of security controls for all types of borders.  The global objective of EFFISEC, a mission oriented project, is to deliver to border authorities more efficient technological equipment: • providing higher security level of identity and luggage control of pedestrians and passengers inside vehicles, at land and maritime checkpoints, • while maintaining or improving the flow of people crossing borders, • and improving work conditions of border inspectors, with more powerful capabilities, less repetitive tasks, and more ergonomic equipment.  EFFISEC will provide border officers with up-to-dated technologies: • allowing systematic in depth controls of travellers, luggage and vehicles, for pedestrians and people inside vehicles, through the use of automatic gates and portable identity check and scanning equipment,  • providing objective criteria for submitting some travellers/vehicles/luggage to an extensive check in specific lanes.   Based on a detailed analysis of the operational requirements (including ergonomics, security and legal issues) for all types of borders, EFFISEC will focus on four technical key issues: documents and identity check, detection of illicit substances, video surveillance and secured communications. The technology proposed will be demonstrated for pedestrians, and travellers using cars and buses; standardisation aspects will be considered and results disseminated.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/social problems/migration","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/217991","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"90955","payments":"19","beneficiaries":"18","total_amount":"11140233.7","startDate":"2009-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Several EU initiatives are ongoing to try to curb this concern. Today’s identity can take various forms, either in the “real” world, as a primary identity delivered by a M.S. (passport, ID card, driving license...) but more and more in the “2.0” world (secondary identity for banking, administration, professional and commercial activities...). Similarly identity theft can take various forms, from stealing citizens' paper documents, or simply by using digital means. Privacy is at the center of all concerns, as any solution must protect citizen’s identity and privacy, whilst not being worse than the problem itself.\nThe major objective of EKSISTENZ is to protect EU citizens’ identities from all current threats but also to foresee what the future threats would be. The project will study in deep the identity theft phenomenon in Europe, revealing the flaws in the different “paper-based” procedures but also in the new dematerialized processes, assess the threat for the citizen and consequently, will develop technological components, backward compatible with different existing M.S. frameworks. EKSISTENZ will also focus on an “identity-as-a-service” approach, to allow M.S. interoperability, leading to a more global system to provide secure and strong identity for all M.S.\nTo achieve this, the consortium will bring together different types of users involved in the identity chain (authorities, industrials, stakeholders, businesses), specialized technology providers and of course, data protection and privacy experts. EKSISTENZ will recommend updates to EU regulations in order to clearly inform, protect, propose responses and increase its resilience following an attempt. Knowing this, identity theft will become, if not impossible, much harder to carry out.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607049","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"188570","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"3482175.0","startDate":"2014-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-05-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Capitalizing on its experience in the EDEN Demonstration Project, in other CBRN relevant projects, and in the CBRN market and supply chain, the ENCIRCLE consortium proposes an innovative approach to reach this goal in a short to long term perspective so that SMEs and large industries can propose and invest in the best innovations on the market.\nThis approach results in 5 objectives aimed at prompting the innovation and business development, and filling market gaps in the project timeframe: \n1. Create an open and neutral EU CBRN cluster,\n2. Provide a sustainable and flexible vision and roadmap for the development of the European CBRN market and innovations,\n3. Provide integration with platforms (systems, tools, services, products) by proposing standardized interfaces and future EU standards to integrate CBRN technologies and innovations developed from the Part b projects,\n4. Support CBRN safety, security and defence commercial and market services,\n5. Improve and facilitate European CBRN dissemination and exploitation.\nThe project will be conducted by a consortium of specialized industries, trade associations and research organisations with flexible and lean procedures under the advice of the EC Community of Users. It will rely on two large interactive communities: practitioners and customers, and industrial and technological providers, the latter including many SMEs. To optimize the needs and gaps assessment and the innovation development, acceptance and success, ENCIRCLE will establish formal links with other consortia such as the future Part b projects.\nThe main expected impact is to enhance the EU CBRN industry competitiveness and enlarge its market while increasing the benefits of the EU research and innovation to improve CBRN preparedness, response, resilience and recovery efficiency.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/economics/sustainable economy;/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/740450","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"209947","payments":"15","beneficiaries":"15","total_amount":"1854397.5","startDate":"2017-03-10 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2021-03-09 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

To achieve this bold goal ENGAGE will start with the knowledge, strategies, methods, tools and practices used by real world practitioners and citizens, and mature results from earlier projects. It will combine and extend these to create innovative solutions to disaster management and new ways of fostering trans-disciplinary collaboration and learning across disciplines. A model for assessing and methods for improving societal resilience will be complemented by an evolving knowledge platform providing actionable solutions meeting the diverse needs of authorities, first responders and citizens. ENGAGE will use empirical data on individual and collective contributions to societal resilience and take into account contextual aspects such as socio-economic conditions, digital literacy, culture, gender, social capital, trust and diversity. It will focus on aspects that can be directly enhanced such as risk awareness, communication, social media, citizens’ as well as authorities’ and first responders’ involvement. Real world field validations will be used to demonstrate and validate ENGAGE solutions and their transferability to diverse contexts across Europe. The consortium is complemented by a Knowledge and Innovation Community of Practice that already has 37 members and will grow during the project.

They could be used for terrorist attacks on the basis of their availability, ease of preparation, the high toxicity and/or the lack of medical countermeasures. Some of the toxins are considered among the most relevant agents in the field of bioterrorism, for which the current preparedness within European countries should be further improved to limit casualties in the case of an intentional release.\nWhile different technologies for toxin detection and analysis have been established, hardly any universally agreed “gold standards” are available. Generally, proficiency tests and certified reference materials for the mentioned toxins are lacking. In this context, the recent results of the first international proficiency test on the detection of one of the toxins provided highly relevant insights and a basis for further development.\nEQuATox will address these issues by creating a network of expert laboratories among EU 27 and associated countries, focussing on the detection of biological toxins and integrating experts from the security, verification, health and food sector.\nFour large EU-wide proficiency tests on the mentioned toxins will be organised with 27 laboratories from 20 countries worldwide so far being interested in participating and joining the network. The task will include the generation and characterisation of toxin reference materials which in the future can be further developed into ISO-compliant certified reference materials.\nBased on the status quo of toxin detection described in EQuATox, good practices and critical gaps in detection technology will be identified as foundation to harmonise and standardise detection capabilities. Furthermore, recommendations will be given on how to close these gaps and to minimise potential health and security risks for European citizens.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/chemical sciences/inorganic chemistry/inorganic compounds","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285120","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"103025","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"9","total_amount":"1338634.0","startDate":"2012-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

This information will enable improved control and management, resulting in real time synchronization between forces on the ground (police, rescue, firefighters) and out-of-theater command and control centers (C&amp;C). The approach guiding the ESS project is based on the fusion of variable forms of field-derived data within a central system which will then provide information analysis and decision support applications at designated C&amp;C locations. To do this, ESS will achieve the following objectives: i) Improvement of front end data collection technologies (radioactivity, bio-chemical, audio-video, etc.) installed both on portable and fixed platforms, providing a flexible yet comprehensive coverage of the affected area; ii) this data will then be fused and analyzed to provide real-time decision support; iii) ESS will make these resources readily available to commanders through the use of easily accessible web-portals. Thus, ESS will minimize the uncertainty that characterizes crisis events, thereby limiting their scope. The ESS will then be field tested at three different scenarios, including a stadium evacuation, a forest fire and toxic waste dump accidents.

In a next step, an analysis is performed to evaluate in which of\nthese critical technologies member states of the EU are dependent on non-EU contributions. A\nresearch agenda to alleviate these critical dependencies through alternative technological solutions will be developed. Methods for the detection and elimination of Critical Dependencies are developed and described.\nStrand 2 looks further into the future. Technologies that are now 'emerging' will be scrutinised to\nevaluate future security implications. A research agenda to keep up, and in some cases take the\nlead, in these technological areas will be developed to avoid future critical dependencies of the EU.\nSeveral well established and some novel methods will be combined to perform these tasks. The\nmethods are compared and/or assessed to improve future strategic research planning.\n\nETCETERA will thus both provide solutions for current problems in strategic security research\nplanning, and develop methodologies for future research planning efforts.'","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261512","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"100522","payments":"14","beneficiaries":"14","total_amount":"1512742.0","startDate":"2011-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-11-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

This shift together with the rapidly changing legal and regulatory landscape has heavily impacted security assurance, governance and compliance. The information security market players have tried to provide suitable solutions to cope with issues such as i) lack of means to provide higher level of assurance (e.g continuous monitoring and auditing), ii) privacy not adequately taken into account, iii) limited transparency and iv) lack of means to streamline risk management and compliance. In the certification space this has resulted in the creation of several schemas creating an additional problem, i.e. the proliferation of certification scheme. The project EU-SEC will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing approaches for assurance and compliance.  The EU-SEC aims to create a framework under which existing, certification and assurance approaches can co-exist. The three core ideas behind the EU-SEC project are that an effective and efficient approach to trust, assurance and compliance has to: (1) balance the need of nations and business sectors to develop their specific certification schemas with the need of CSPs to reduce compliance costs (2) avoid that humans (auditors) do activities that can be performed by machines (e.g. collecting data) (3) make sure that accurate and reliable evidences/information are provided to relevant people, in a timely fashion, leveraging as much as possible automatic means. The EU-SEC framework will equip stakeholders in the ICT security ecosystem with a validated governance structure, a reference architecture, and the corresponding set of tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current approach to security governance, risks management, assurance and compliance. The EU-SEC aims to enhancing trustworthiness and transparency in the ICT supply chain through business cases developed and piloted by industrial partners.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/731845","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"207439","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"2997812.5","startDate":"2017-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Forensic genetics is a highly innovative field of applied science with a strong impact on the security of citizens. However, the genetic methods to identify offenders as well as the creation of national DNA databases have caused concerns to the possible violation of privacy rights. Furthermore, studies to assess the societal dimension of security following the implementation of even more intrusive methods such as the genetic prediction of externally visible characteristics are highly relevant for their public acceptance. The network includes some of the leading groups in European forensic genetic research. It aims to create a closer integration of existing collaborations, as well as establishing new interactions in the field of security, as all key players are addressed: scientists, stakeholders, end-users, educational centres and scientific societies. Only if a long-term collaborative network can be established it will become possible to connect all scientific groups active in the field of forensic genetics, and to initiate a sustained effort covering all aspects of research. These efforts have to be combined with identifying and selecting the most innovative ideas to meet the challenges of analyzing biological crime scene samples compromised by degradation or indentified as mixtures of traces from multiple human sources. The proposal integrates five working packages. WP 1 is devoted to management and coordination. WP 2 will lead the activities aimed at the creation of the virtual centre of research. WP 3 will carry out exemplar projects as models of collaboration and integration of cutting edge research, later complemented by a competitive call for new research projects. The societal dimension of security as well as the ethical and legal aspects wil be addressed in WP 4, whereas WP 5 is devoted to education and training.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/databases;/natural sciences/biological sciences/genetics and heredity","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285487","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102075","payments":"20","beneficiaries":"18","total_amount":"6985546.0","startDate":"2012-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

In order to achieve these aims, EUSECON builds an integrated and collaborative approach, which will lay the foundations for the development of a new European multidisciplinary research agenda in security economics and security policy. The unifying theme of the proposed research are the human drivers of the new insecurity, that is terrorism and organized crime. Specifically, EUSECON analyses the causes, dynamics and long-term effects of both human-induced insecurity threats and European security policies. The approach will promote in-depth understanding of insecurity threats emerging from terrorism and organised crime with a view to uncover the much-needed information base for effective domestic and international security policy. In terms of proven research performance in this field and relevant past policy advisory activities, the sixteen members of the consortium represent the best economists and social scientists in this field in Europe today. It is expected that EUSECON will significantly advance the European research capacity well beyond the life.-time of this project, even vis-à-vis the currently strongly dominant American research capacity.

Humans could be overwhelmed by fast changes of potentially dangerous incidents occurring at confined environments with mass-gathering. They could fail to make objective decisions to find their way to safety. This condition may lead to mass panic and make emergency management more challenging. In eVACUATE, the intelligent fusion of sensors, geospatial and contextual information, with advanced multi-scale crowd behaviour detection and recognition will be developed. The structured fusion of sensing information with dynamic estimated uncertainties on behaviour predictions will advance eVACUATE crowd dynamic models; and virtual reality simulations of crowds in confined environments.  A service oriented Decision-Support System shall be developed to dynamically distribute on-demand evacuation information to emergency management actors as the crisis unfolds. Decision-makers at the command posts, first responders, front-line stewards and volunteers receive real-time situation aware information of updated evacuation strategies using robust and resilient eVACUATE information and communication infrastructure. Smart spaces of electronic, audio and other mobile devices shall be connected to the integrated system to provide safer evacuation routings for people. The eVACUATE system performance and scalability will be validated in four distinct scenarios involving incidents with large crowd at various venues with the requirements of evacuation time reductions and increases of safety and security.

Mobile phones are often a key factor in criminal cases, intrusions, intellectual property theft, security threats, and more. The data stored in these devices may contain critical evidence associated with the above-mentioned crimes. \nThe latest generation of devices incorporate new security features and encryption schemes to 'protect' the device and its associated user data. The other side of the coin is that the rapid processing of critical evidence by various information retrieval techniques is slowed down, if not made impossible. The mobile device forensics field is a challenging area for forensic analysts, particularly given the increasing number of data encryption mechanisms.\nThe EXFILES project aims to provide law enforcement agencies (LEAs) with new tools to extract data and associated evidence from these devices in strict legal contexts. A unique consortium of five LEAs, universities and cyber security companies from the EU have joined forces to address these challenges. Together, they defined three areas of work on technical data extraction techniques, namely software exploitation, hardware methods and combined methods. In addition, tools and methods inspired by other areas of information security (e.g. security assessments based on common criteria) will lead to new judicial methods of accessing data for lawful investigations. Another unique dimension of EXFILES is the clear focus on the ethical and legal aspects of research and exploitation as well as dissemination and training activities for the next generation of forensic experts.\nThe main objective of EXFILES project is to improve Law Enforcement Agencies techniques and methods, to extract digital evidence from modern encrypted smartphones used by criminals based on holistic approach (both software and hardware).\n'","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/information engineering/telecommunications/mobile phone","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883156","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"229113","payments":"14","beneficiaries":"14","total_amount":"6999596.25","startDate":"2020-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2023-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

During the last 2 years, the company’s founders have been developing innovative UAV platforms, software applications, payloads, and material technologies. AERDRON has been actively developing an aerial monitoring solution called EXTREMDRON. The EXTREMDRON series of UAVs addresses many of the limitations of products currently available in terms of environmental limitations, material performance, security applications, operating envelope, and flight performance. The EXTREMDRON can operate in extreme environments which would keep other UAVs grounded during security/public safety critical events. \n\nOur last project, ED1 EXTREMDRON was another step in AERDRON strategic roadmap for developing high tech, and industrialized UAVs for professional sensing applications. The ED1 is equipped with a proprietary developed software that configures sensors, cameras, and encrypts communications thru an onboard computer. The ED1 was fully designed, engineered, and manufactured in house per our company’s commitment to home grown innovation.\n\nAERDRON recognizes that Europe/world faces increasing security threats against its civilians, and critical/soft infrastructure targets. The frequency of attacks against civilian soft targets in Europe is alarming, and new technologies must be developed in the coming years to create a counterforce multiplier. There is a real need for aerial monitoring/sensing solutions focused on the protection of heavily populated areas, and critical/soft infrastructures. AERDRON proposal EXTREMDRON focuses on a creating a NexGen UAV for aerial monitoring applications in extreme operating environments (fires, radiation/nuclear, hazardous chemicals). This niche UAV application has not been successfully realized by any products currently on the market, and there is a real world need for these capabilities to save lives, and critical infrastructures. The EXTREMDRON provides a means to monitor and collect data in extreme environments for security agencies to analyze, collect data, identify threats, and means to rapidly respond to life critical situations which ground crews cannot enter an area for safety reasons. The EXTREMDRON also provides industries/government agencies the means to measure dangerous airborne substances at the disaster location, and its dissipation over populated areas. The EXTREMDRON will be a valuable tool in protecting public safety, and critical infrastructures.  \n\nAERDRON plans to carry out a small-scale demonstration of our innovative prototype EXTREMDRON with the aim of adjusting the physical scale of the UAV (ED2). Some of the activities include: test and adapt new raw materials, perform product design, define the production process and demonstrate and validate its efficacy in small scale actions. But before a rigorous business plan has to be carried out, we need to study of physical scale needs, deploy and classify possible raw materials requirements, establish a production forecast, and estimate the amount of investment in the product manufacturing system, carry out study of legal viability, including IPR issues, carry out a market research and complete a business plan scoping 10 years.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/economics and business;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/robotics/autonomous robots/drones;/engineering and technology/mechanical engineering/vehicle engineering/aerospace engineering;/engineering and technology/mechanical engineering/vehicle engineering/aerospace engineering/aircraft","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/717915","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"201726","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2016-04-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-07-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The toolkit combines novel security tools from leading European technology vendors and will be validated in large-scale demonstrations by end-users.\nThe EnergyShield toolkit will combine the latest technologies for vulnerability assessment (automated threat modelling and security behaviour analysis), monitoring & protection (anomaly detection and DDoS mitigation) and learning & sharing (security information and event management). \nThe integrative approach of the project is unique as insights produced by the various tools will be combined to provide a unique level of visibility to the users. For example, it will be possible to combine vulnerability scanning with automated threat modelling to provide insights into software vulnerabilities present in an architecture in combination with insights into what are the key assets, risks and weak links of the architecture. The toolbox will allow end-users to predict future attacks (as it provides insights to what attacks can be applied to the weakest links of the architecture) and learn from past attacks (for example using the insights from the vulnerability assessment and threat modelling to prevent attacks, and learning from attacks to update the probabilistic meta-model of the threat modelling).\nThe toolkit will be implemented with the complete EPES value chain who will contribute to the specification, prototyping and demonstration phases of the project. Although the toolkit will be tailored to the needs of EPES operators, many of the technology building blocks and best practices will be transferable to other types of critical infrastructures. \nThe consortium consists of 2 large industrial partners (SIVECO and PSI), whereof SIVECO is taking the lead  supported by 6 innovative SMEs, 3 academic research organizations and 7 end-users representing various parts of the EPES value chain.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/832907","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"224136","payments":"19","beneficiaries":"19","total_amount":"7421437.5","startDate":"2019-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2022-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Smart Home networks become crowded, difficult to maintain and vulnerable. Today’s Smart Home systems, such as smart TVs, Internet-connected camera systems, alarm sensors, smart light bulbs or thermostats, can be hacked only in few minutes and provide a wealth of data about the way people live, bank information, legal information and etc.\nPerytons proposes a centralized diagnostic solution for the Smart Home Operators, called Eye-O-T. The Eye-O-T enables the operators to monitor and analyze in real time a large number of IoT networks, distributed over many remote sites and running different local communication protocols. The system is composed by plug & play probes that capture Smart Home IoT edge and gateway traffics and send it to the cloud through the existing broadband infrastructure; and an intuitive real-time dashboard. The Eye-O-T security system not only enables Smart Home owners to minimise their house and privacy vulnerability to security breaches and malicious attacks, but also reduces the Smart Home maintenance cost for operators by 30% and increases the operator’s deployment capacity of at least 10%.\nThe Phase 1 project will allow Perytons to define a minimum viable product, plan a feasible cyber security and centralized monitoring system scale-up, elaborate the business scale up, and size the reachable market and a reliable market share. Within the overall project, Perytons aims to: scale up the solution to be able to support large scale IoT network deployment, ingrate the system with one large cloud service, interface the solution with common Network Management solutions and demonstrate Eye-O-T visibility and security trough a large scale pilot in houses with 300 probes deployed in Germany and the UK together with Smart Home Operators.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet/internet of things;/engineering and technology/civil engineering/architecture engineering/home automation","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/736300","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"205793","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2016-08-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

In fact, in May 2014 the European Central Bank (ECB) published a list of recommendations for increased banking security and biometrics was included as one of the most secure authentication methods. Concerns about banking security have always existed, but it has been after the breakthrough of online and mobile banking when bank fraud has become major issue to address with urgency. Currently, banking authentication is typically done by using 4-6 digits PIN codes. This form of authentication provides an extremely low security, especially in online banking where cybercriminals can hack this PIN code in a matter of seconds. As a result, the total value of fraudulent transactions is rapidly increasing year by year, being now estimated at €1.44 billion solely in Europe. In this scenario, biometrics holds great promise to become a reference banking authentication method in a near future. However, despite the clear opportunity there are still some barriers preventing the banking biometrics breakthrough, at least on a large scale.\nFacePhi has developed a face recognition technology, specifically designed to overcome the current barriers preventing the large scale deployment of banking biometrics. Now, in the FACCESS Phase 2 project we seek demonstrating our facial recognition technology can actually unleash the large scale deployment of banking biometrics by the implementation of our product in the mobile/online platforms of 6 international banking institutions.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/733711","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"206764","payments":"2","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"1742600.0","startDate":"2015-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-11-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The entire innovation process, from components development to the final design of the user interface, will continuously be evaluated by the two end user groups, travellers and border guards.\nBorder control is a major challenge for security and mobility within the EU. Travellers request a minimum delay and a speedy border crossing, while Border Guards must fulfil their obligation to secure the EUs borders against illegal immigration and other threats. Fastpass will serve both demands at the same time to keep security at the highest level while increasing the speed and the comfort for all legitimate travellers at all border control points.\nThe FastPass ABC process will be designed to address both requirements with equal emphasis. One aspect of a speedy border crossing by legitimate travellers is a harmonised user interface. This will allow frequent travellers from Europe and third country states to pass through an ABC with minimum delay, using the full potential of ID documents. Improved traveller identification technologies, such as new biometric modules will increase the security of the ABC process and minimise spoofing.\nA demonstration and evaluation at all types of border (air, land and sea) will be implemented in at least three different member states.

In an FE system the decryptor deciphers a function over the message plaintext: such functional decryptability makes it feasible to process encrypted data (e.g. on the Internet) and obtain a partial view of the message plaintext. This extra flexibility over classical encryption is a powerful enabler for many emerging security technologies (i.e. controlled access, searching and computing on encrypted data, program obfuscation…). \nFENTEC’s mission is to make the functional encryption paradigm ready for wide-range applications, integrating it in ICT technologies as naturally as classical encryption. The primary objective is the efficient and application-oriented development of functional encryption systems. FENTEC’s team of cryptographers, software and hardware experts and information technology industry partners that will document functional encryption needs of specific applications and subsequently design, develop, implement and demonstrate applied use of functional cryptography. \nUltimately, a functional encryption library for both SW and HW-oriented application will be documented and made public so that it may be used by European ICT entities. With it, the FENTEC team will build emerging security technologies that increase the trustworthiness of the European ICT services and products. Concretely, the FENTEC team will showcase the expressiveness and versatility of the functional encryption paradigm in 3 use cases:\n• Privacy-preserving digital currency, enforcing flexible auditing models\n• Anonymous data analytics enabling computation of statistics over encrypted data, protecting European Fundamental Rights of Data Protection and Privacy\n• Key and content distribution with improved performance & efficiency as foundational technology for establishing secure communication among a vast amount of IOT devices.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/data analysis","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/780108","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213111","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"9","total_amount":"4223141.25","startDate":"2018-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Almost all such knowledge can be abused or cause damage through inadequate use. In a free society this should not hinder free generation and exchange of knowledge. As the pace of science-based development accelerates, there is a pressing need for continual scanning of the unfolding technology landscape for potential security threats. Looking ahead to 2030, the foresight study will identify and assess security threats that could stem from future technologies. Robotics, Cognition, New Materials, Nano and Biotechnologies are some of the fields to be scanned. FESTOS will stimulate an 'out of the box' anticipatory thinking and construct threat scenarios by analysing the impact of the identified threats on the background of envisioned “security climates” (societal context of security issues). The threat scenarios will be evaluated in terms of their levels of impact and uncertainty. In conjunction with each scenarios critical early-warning indicators will be identified, namely signals that hint at a growing likelihood of specific scenarios and thus provide basis for possible prevention means. Societal issues will be discussed, as well as the controversial issue of controlled dissemination of scientific knowledge in the context of necessary trade-offs between security and the freedom of research and knowledge. Finally policy recommendations will be derived, aiming at novel means of preparedness. Adequate mix of Foresight methods will be employed, e.g. horizon scanning, weak signals analysis, expert surveys, brainstormings, “futures wheel”, interactive scenario building, STEEPV analysis.

Further, we claim the need for the development of a common research culture that is to be achieved by better cooperation between practitioner and research/industry organisations. FIRE-IN addresses these objectives through four main areas of activity: (i) the identification and harmonisation of operational capability gaps based on the contribution provided by a significant and heterogeneous practitioner network, (ii) the identification of promising solutions to address those gaps through monitoring and screening of research outcomes and the continuous involvement of research and industry representatives, (iii) the definition of a F&R Strategic Research and Standardisation Agenda (SRSA) based on the previous  elements as well as (iv) the development of a concept for more efficient use of test & demonstration and training facilities to support innovation and joint skill development. \nThe overarching result of the project will be a proven process for organising F&R capability-driven research based on a wide practitioner and research and innovation network.

Law enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are still using conventional, manpower based techniques to gather forensic evidence. Concealed surveillance devices can provide irrefutable evidences, but current video surveillance systems are usually bulky and complicated, are often used as simple video recorders, and require complex, expensive infrastructure to supply power, bandwidth, storage and illumination.  \nRecent years have seen significant advances in the surveillance industry, but these were rarely targeted to forensic applications. The imaging community is fixated on cameras for mobile phones, where the figures of merit are resolution, image quality, and low profile. A mobile phone with its camera on would consume its battery in under two hours. Industrial surveillance cameras are even more power hungry, while intelligent algorithms such as face detection often require extremely high processing power, such as backend server farms, and are not available in conventional surveillance systems.  \n\nHere we propose to develop and validate a novel, ultra-low-power, intelligent, miniaturised, low-cost, wireless, autonomous sensor (“FORENSOR”) for evidence gathering. Its ultra-sensitive camera and built-in intelligence will allow it to operate at remote locations, automatically identify pre-defined criminal events, and alert LEAs in real time while providing and storing the relevant video, location and timing evidence. FORENSOR will be able to operate for up to two months with no additional infrastructure. It will be manageable remotely, preserve the availability and the integrity of the collected evidence, and comply with all legal and ethical standards, in particular those related to privacy and personal data protection. The combination of built-in intelligence with ultra-low power consumption could help LEAs take the next step in fighting severe crimes.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/information engineering/telecommunications/mobile phone;/social sciences/law;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653355","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194854","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"4043546.25","startDate":"2015-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-02-28 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Criminal offenders use phones to communicate, coordinate, organise and execute criminal actions. This is especially true for organised crime and terrorist organisations. This development provides new challenges for criminal prosecution and it is vital to empower law enforcement to access the data stored on mobile devices to use it as court evidence in a trustworthy and reliable manner.  The overarching objective of FORMOBILE is to establish a complete end to end forensic investigation chain, targeting for mobile devices. To achieve this goal three objectives will be pursued. Novel tools shall be developed that include the acquisition of previously unavailable mobile data, unlocking mobile devices, as well as the decoding and analysis of mobile data. Based on the definition of requirements of law enforcement and legal and ethical issues a new mobile forensics standard shall be developed. With the developments of the new standard and the new tools, training for police and criminal prosecution will be established, providing the end users with the latest knowledge in a novel and an innovative curriculum to ensure a quality standard of investigations.   The European Union has developed as a Security Union, building on the European Agenda on Security. This aims to ensure that people live in an area of freedom, security and justice, without internal frontiers. To strengthen digital forensics in the context of criminal investigations is crucial to achieve this vision. FORMOBILE contributes to the fight against virtually all forms of crime. This is because mobile devices are widely used in crimes, especially in the arrangement of conspiracies. Yet, there are crimes more closely related to mobile devices; this includes child abuse and emerging forms of cybercrime in particular.

{"id":"272","name":"FutureTPM - Future Proofing the Connected World: A Quantum-Resistant Trusted Platform Module","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"The goal of FutureTPM is to design a Quantum-Resistant (QR) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) by designing and developing QR algorithms suitable for inclusion in a TPM. The algorithm design will be accompanied with implementation and performance evaluation, as well as formal security analysis in the full range of TPM environments: i.e. hardware, software and virtualization environments. Use cases in online banking, activity tracking and device management will provide environments and applications to validate the FutureTPM framework.\n\nSecurity, privacy and trust in a computing system are usually achieved using tamper-resistant devices to provide core cryptographic and security functions. The TPM is one such device and provides the system with a root-of-trust and a cryptographic engine. However, to sustain this enhanced system security it is crucial that the crypto functions in the TPM are not merely secure for today but will also remain secure in the long-term against quantum attacks.\n\nFutureTPM will address this challenge by providing robust and provably-secure QR algorithms for a new generation of TPMs. Research on quantum computers has drawn enormous attention from governments and industry; if, as predicted, a large-scale quantum computer becomes a reality within the next 15 years, existing public-key algorithms will be open to attack. Any significant change to a TPM takes time and requires theoretical and practical research before adoption. Therefore, to ensure a smooth transition to QR cryptography we should start now. A key strategic objective of FutureTPM is to contribute to standardization efforts at EU level within TCG, ISO/IEC and ETSI. The consortium consists of high calibre industrial and academic partners from across Europe, combining QR crypto researchers with TPM developers. Because the TPM shares many functions in common with other widely-used devices, such as HSMs and TEEs, the FutureTPM solution is expected to benefit them as well.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/779391","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213057","payments":"17","beneficiaries":"17","total_amount":"4868890.0","startDate":"2018-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Current training puts few resources into training personnel in these critical soft skills. Gaming for Peace (GAP) provides an efficient and effective means of developing and delivering a curriculum in those skills. Deriving a base curriculum from CPPB relevant soft skills and end user identified training gaps in this area, GAP designs a multiple player online role playing game which simulates scenarios from CPPB missions. The GAP project launches an iterative process of curriculum development and refinement through end users (military, police and civilian personnel)  evaluating the game and embedded base curriculum by playing the game and in doing so, bringing their own experiences to the game, thus further developing the curriculum of CPPB relevant soft skills. The game can be accessed anywhere via the Internet and there is no limit on the number of personnel who can be trained. The game can be customized at low cost by different stakeholders.

These genomic databanks, containing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data, commonly used for healthcare and biomedical purposes, can be a massive source of inexpensive and reliable DNA fingerprints with broad applications in forensics, law enforcement and identification purposes. \nThis system will be based in the count of short-tandem repeats (STRs) allowing collation with existing CODIS and CODIS-based databases . Additionally, the company wants to explore a method for generating DNA fingerprinting based on the hashing of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), which can lead to a potentially cheaper and fast-er mechanism for collating biological samples with the database. The generated fingerprints will always be complete-ly devoid of any personal, health or private information, thus enabling identification while ensuring privacy protec-tion. \nGenomcore Identity can represent a qualitative leap in biometric identification since: \n1.\tAddresses the controversial topic of using public and commercial genomic databanks for biometric identification, while preserving the privacy of the DNA donors through the proxy.\n2.\tProvides a controlled, extremely valuable and yet inexpensive solution to authorities for collating new DNA profiles with already existing genomic databases, extending DNA forensics to use cases that are unfeasible nowadays (i.e., a fast identification of large cohorts of victims in accidents or terrorist attacks). \n3.\tProvides legacy compatibility with CODIS profiles but also offers a new option to use SNP hashes, offering higher sensitivity, shorter response times and a ~50% less cost than existing methodologies.\n4.\tThe SNP hashing technique has the potential to use the new generation of portable DNA sequencers.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/databases;/natural sciences/biological sciences/genetics and heredity/nucleotide;/natural sciences/biological sciences/genetics and heredity/genome;/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/790554","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213280","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2018-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Filling the need and gap in the marker for highly-portable, broadly-specific decontamination methods, Aquila BioScience has developed a novel Glyco-DeCon system. At the development stage the unique combination of sugars capturing biothreat agents was identified by using a novel microarray technology. In the Glyco-DeCon wipe, the sugars are chemically attached to the surface of a pre-treated, self-contained cellulose-based material. This approach targets natural binding sites of the biothreat agents and offers a non-toxic alternative to the harsh chemical decontamination methods. The Glyco-DeCon wipe is the safest method for biological decontamination described so far and can be used on human skin as well as the delicate surfaces of the mucosal epithelia or the human eye. Moreover, the product uses natural compounds like cotton and purified proteins reducing the environmental burden of toxic chemical approaches. The Glyco-DeCon kit is intended to become part of all first responder kits.\n\nThe Glyco-DeCon wipes have already been tested in Defence accredited labs and confirmed to be effective against persistent biothreat agents, including anthrax cells and spores. Over the next six months Aquila BioScience is intending to perform field testing for the prototype developed with support of Irish Defence Forces and will discuss the most suitable formats with the end users. Moreover, a patent application is being submitted for protecting the invented technology. The team will look into business and production feasibility to indicate the best distribution partner and to introduce the product into the market within the following year. The findings will be summarized in Feasibility Report and elaborated Business Plan.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/medical and health sciences/health sciences/infectious disease;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/791486","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213321","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2018-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

By 2050, c. 70% of people are likely to be city dwellers, compared with less than 30% in 1950. This trend brings with it increased security and safety threats in urban areas, not least to urban built infrastructure. The central aim of HARMONISE (A Holistic Approach to Resilience and Systematic ActiOns to Make Large Scale UrbaN Built Infrastructure SEcure) is to develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted, yet mutually-reinforcing concept for the enhanced security, resilience and sustainability of large scale urban built infrastructure and development.\nLarge scale urban built infrastructure is a critical component within the intertwined networks of urban areas, which include not only physical components, but also integrated hardware and software aspects. To date, a comprehensive and holistic approach to improve the resilience and security of large scale urban developments (i.e. shopping centres/areas, sports venues or business centres with underground transportation nodes) against attacks and disruptions, has not been developed thoroughly.\nHARMONISE will be grounded in a holistic view of innovation, and will advocate synergies with, and augmentation of, relevant existing, past or ongoing projects. The project recognises the necessity to improve the design of urban areas and increase their security against, and resilience, to new threats. Specifically, HARMONISE seeks to deliver (a) a holistic urban resilience integrated information platform; (b) a suite of innovative tools (toolkit hosted within the HARMONISE platform); (c) greater understanding and awareness of urban security and resilience vis-a-vis dissemination activities; and, (d) commercialisation opportunities among emerging new markets in this field.

These critical infrastructures are potential targets for which cyber-attacks could be potentially devastating. Due to the increasing use of web applications in any sector, attacks are very often based on exploiting web application vulnerabilities, being currently vulnerable almost any web application. The software frameworks and programming environments used to develop web applications do not provide adequate functionalities to eliminate web security risks, and the current cyber security solutions (represented mainly by WAF solutions) do not cover the end-users’ needs properly (due to their complex and costly deployment and maintenance). Moreover, the protection level they offeris limited (up to 75% of risks). To overcome this situation, this project presents HDIV, a technology that follows a security by design approach, generating self-protected web applications. HDIV is integrated within the web applications and within the web application development environments. It eliminates the complexity and maintenance cost of WAF solutions and increases the protection levels up to 90%.\nThe MAIN OBJECTIVE of the project is to accelerate the introduction into the worldwide market of a set of products based on HDIV, contributing to solve the important threats derived from web application weaknesses. Through the activities proposed, the project leader ARIMA will complete the development of a set of market ready products that will allow exploiting the full potential of HDIV on the markets addressed:\n-Current market of web security solutions, where the potential customers are organizations with high security concerns  requirements.\n-The market associated to web application developers and development companies.\n-A new niche market, constituted by organizations with less security concerns and requirements.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet/web development","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/696973","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"199220","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"927500.0","startDate":"2015-11-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Cyber-attacks can  harm  intangible  assets  like  reputation,  IPR,  expertise,  and  know-how. And  there  is  severe  imbalance  between  the  efficiency  of attacks  and  inadequate defences, due in part to the lack of quantitative information for decision makers to prioritise security investments. \nTo foster a culture of risk management by an individual organisation or a complete sector, HERMENEUT answers: What is the real fallout of a data compromise and the long-run consequences on associated assets? What are the losses for intangible assets?

It is well known that, all over Europe, current first-responder networks use a large number of different and incompatible technologies therefore compromising efficient coordination of combined operations (such as cross-border or crisis management). It is also known that European organizations dealing with public-safety have invested in dedicated critical systems (to ensure high-availability and reliability). This includes dedicated networks of, among others, PMR (Professional Mobile Radio) and, more specifically, TETRA (TErrestrial Trunked RAdio). Moreover, with the fast development of communications technologies, new capabilities and opportunities are being adopted and exploited by early-adopters FRs, such as ad-hoc mesh broadband networks, able to provide and/or extend connectivity over affected areas (e.g., underground and destroyed area) and to deliver high data throughput (higher than 5Mbps)\n\nTherefore, to answer FRs needs, HIT-GATE will be developed to support a mix of technologies used today by organizations involved in Public-Safety, ranging from legacy-PMR, TETRA to next-generation networks. In this way, organizations may keep their existing systems and/or adopt novel technologies, since the proposed HIT-GATE solution is future proof and ensures communications interoperability between the networks (limited, of course, to the limitations in capabilities of each network). HIT-GATE will also enable communications across heterogeneous networks between first responders during operations. By connecting HIT-GATE to their networks, FRs may continue to use their current receiver equipments, communications base-stations and communications infrastructures.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/284940","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102278","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"3951290.87","startDate":"2012-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-07-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The task is also to review freely available recipes (for instance on internet) and to evaluate their dangerousness. During the study, several basic questions should be answered, how can HMEs be produced from ordinary commercially available chemicals and materials?  What type of chemicals are available freely today for the direct use in HMEs? How can freely available chemicals be easily chemically changed or concentrated so they can be used for the production of HMEs? What are the concentration limits of precursors or HME formulations for them to be usable by terrorists? What is the chemical stability of HMEs? (What time span does a terrorist have between the production of an HME and the execution of an attack?). What can be done to prevent or inhibit the production of HMEs? The research of this project must be performed in close collaboration with manufacturers of precursors. The project also requires the participation from end users such as police or security services. Extensive attention should be given to dual-use and ethical issues.

Despite the existence of numerous risk assessment tools to support the utility providers in estimating the nature and impact of possible incidents, risk management up till now is mostly a matter of best practice approaches. Risk management tools are mostly focused on one of two major topics:\n- the utility network physical infrastructure, consisting of, e.g. gas, water pipes or power lines\n- the utility’s control network including SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks and business and       information systems.\n\nIn the context of utility providers, these network types exhibit a significant interaction, and therefore risk management methods that focus on just one of these network types might be insufficient – referred to as interconnected utility infrastructures in this description.\nThe main objective of this project is to identify and evaluate ‘Hybrid Risk Metrics’ for assessing and categorising security risks in interconnected utility infrastructure networks in order to provide foundations for novel protection and prevention mechanisms.\n\nThe project will provide utility network providers with a risk assessment tool that – in adherence with, e.g., the BSI or ICNC recommendations – supports qualitative risk assessment based on numerical (quantitative) techniques. For that matter, our method will explicitly account for the infrastructure’s two-fold nature in terms of the utility network and the control network alongside it. The expected impact is thus a movement away from best practice only, towards the treatment of risk in utility networks based on a sound and well-understood mathematical foundation. The project will take an explicit step towards considering security in the given context of utility networks, ultimately yielding a specially tailored solution that is optimal for the application at hand.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas;/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/608090","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"185511","payments":"8","beneficiaries":"8","total_amount":"3387085.0","startDate":"2014-04-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Recommended procedures for explosive detection are inherently unsafe: due to current technological limitations, EU regulations only prescribe screenings on a variable percentage of randomly chosen passengers. Being not portable, such devices can only be installed at screening lines - but in Brussels 2016 explosions happened way before them. Moreover, existing devices just allow to analyse swabbed points instead of the passengers’ total body. In the meantime, those procedures are slow (up to 30 s/passenger) and intrusive, requiring physical contact (swabbing): two major drawbacks, considering that airports competition is based today on passenger experience. \nEye on Air developed I-MUST, a handheld disruptive device based on a proprietary, ultra-thin and high sensitive Ion Mobility Spectrometry sensor.  Embedded into I-MUST, it ensures the most secure detection of explosives, with a sensitivity 500 times higher than its competitors (0.1 ppb) and the detection of  >150 compounds, i.e. 3 to 5 times more compounds than currently used technology. I-MUST can be used not only at screening lines, but everywhere in public places, allowing to introduce the concept of a “distributed security” and, thanks to the brief time of analysis (2 s), 100% passengers can be scanned. By using short ion beams and a small, annular drift space, Eye on Air obtained such performing, enabling technology, whose features have already been confirmed in October 2015 by TNO, the Dutch research institute devoted to the certification of airport screening devices. \nDuring Phase 1 project, Eye on Air will assess the scale-up industrialization plan and will evaluate a sound go-to-market strategy to ensure successful commercialization of the I-MUST device for airport explosive detection.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/744926","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"207645","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2016-12-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

In order to realise this goal, the ICARUS project proposes to equip first responders with a comprehensive and integrated set of unmanned search and rescue tools, to increase the situational awareness of human crisis managers and to assist search and rescue teams for dealing with the difficult and dangerous, but life-saving task of finding human survivors.\nAs every crisis is different, it is impossible to provide one solution which fits all needs. Therefore, the ICARUS project will concentrate on developing components or building blocks that can be directly used by the crisis managers when arriving on the field. The ICARUS tools consist of assistive unmanned air, ground and sea vehicles, equipped with human detection sensors.  The ICARUS unmanned vehicles are intended as the first explorers of the area, as well as in-situ supporters to act as safeguards to human personnel. The unmanned vehicles collaborate as a coordinated team, communicating via ad hoc cognitive radio networking. To ensure optimal human-robot collaboration, these ICARUS tools are seamlessly integrated into the C4I equipment of the human crisis managers and a set of training and support tools is provided to the human crisis to learn to use the ICARUS system.\nFurthermore, the project aims to provide an integrated proof-of-concept solution, to be evaluated by a board of expert end-users that can verify that operational needs are addressed.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/information engineering/telecommunications/radio technology/cognitive radio;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285417","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102326","payments":"28","beneficiaries":"28","total_amount":"12584933.45","startDate":"2012-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Conventional top-down institutional reform has proven neither effective nor sustainable. Community-based policing (COP) holds promise, however evaluations have pointed to a lack of in-depth understanding of police-community relations in police reform assistance. This project will conduct integrated social and technical research on COP in post-conflict countries in S.E. Europe, Asia, Africa and Central America. New knowledge, reflection on lessons learnt and “best practices” will support both national police and EU/International police reform assistance. The project will lead to a better understanding of police-community relations, and innovation in information and communication technology (ICT) for enhancing these relations in post-conflict countries undergoing serious security reform. Linking social and technological research, the project will study social, cultural, human security, legal and ethical dimensions of COP to understand how citizens and police can develop sustainable relations with the use of ICTs. We will explore how technological innovation can support COP in crime reporting and prevention. The project will explore ICT solutions to facilitate, strengthen and accelerate positive COP efforts and police-citizen interactions where trust levels are weak. Solutions will depend on the context and identified needs of end-users: communities, local police, national and international police (EU/UN), and policymakers, and may include citizen reporting, information monitoring, mobile value transfer, or improved organizational systems. The project includes a Policing Experts Network whose role is to support research planning, and dissemination and exploitation of findings, grounding the research in police practice.

To this end, the EU adopted eIDAS Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. Nevertheless, eIDAS provides a regulatory environment with three assurance levels (low, substantial and high) but it is up to the Member States to define both the tools needed for each assurance level and the associated financial services allowed per level. This has resulted in a fragmented landscape of electronic identity and complicated procedures. This is a barrier for people and companies to online access to national and cross-border financial services, hindering as well the development of the FS industry in Europe as a digital single market. \nSignicat is the first identity assurance as a service provider to the financial industry in the Nordic countries. Our main innovation is the integration of different tools for identity assurance to help financial institutions to comply with legislation while simplifying user’s online onboarding through one-stop-shop. With IDAaaS Phase 2 we will further develop our Toolbox to properly meet national requirements in other European countries, and to also develop new eID assurance services to take advantage of the new business opportunities open up next year by the upcoming PSD2.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/humanities/history and archaeology/history;/social sciences/sociology/governance/taxation","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/784247","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213560","payments":"2","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"1408462.0","startDate":"2016-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-11-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

IDetecT 4ALL goal is to develop an innovative, Optical Intruder Sensing and Authentication Technology, that will dramatically improve the Cost/Performance ratio of security systems, thus becoming an enabler for the widespread availability of reliable and affordable security, leading to more CIs being protected. iDetecT 4ALL proposes to develop a novel Photonic Sensing technology based on an innovative approach utilizing ultra low cost electro-optical components. This novel approach enables to detect and Authenticate objects by a single sensor. The suggested concept is based on illuminating the protected area with invisible, modulated light, and by using a solid state scanning and detecting technique, to continuously monitor the 3D surface profile within the protected area.  Presence and location of intruders will be detected from the variations inflicted on this 3D profile. By integrating additional novel optical ID tagging techniques onto authorized objects (personnel, vehicles and goods) the sensing technology will also be able to reliably identify, authenticate and alert real threats introduced by unauthorized intruders into restricted areas. This innovative approach is enabled by a recently invented efficient digital signal processing (DSP) technique enabling range measurement using continuous modulated invisible (or visible) light signals and requires far less peak power than Laser scanning technologies.

These characteristics are distinguished by many diverse emergency response organisations that need to collaborate across technological systems, organisational borders as well as language and cultural barriers. They do not have the same background knowledge and arrive at different points in time. Technologies and procedures currently used in multinational disaster response and prior EU funded projects have provided many solutions for single aspects, but to the best of the Consortium’s knowledge there is no concept available yet which supports the entire process.\nThis situation is the motivation for IDIRA. The mentioned characteristics of multinational disaster response led to the conclusion that we shall develop a system of technologies and guidelines which help in optimal resource planning and operations across national and organisational borders. The set of tools, interfaces and procedures developed in IDIRA will be designed to be configured, deployed and operated in a flexible manner, providing interoperable services for data integration, information exchange, resource planning and decision support to local and international disaster response units and decision makers.\nThis core result of IDIRA will take the form an architectural framework and an exemplary implementation of a Mobile Integrated Command and Control Structure supporting co-ordinated large-scale disaster management. It is foreseen to make the best possible use of existing ideas, technology and standards, integrating available solutions and complementing them with new components where necessary. In actual operation, the components based on IDIRA solutions will be building on and be integrated with local command & control infrastructure and response procedures.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/humanities/languages and literature/languages - general","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261726","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"98968","payments":"19","beneficiaries":"19","total_amount":"8032971.06","startDate":"2011-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"328","name":"IMPRINT - Defeat of Insider Theft in Nuclear and Radioactive Sites","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"'Insider threats are perhaps the most serious challenges that nuclear security systems face. All of the cases of theft of nuclear materials where the circumstances of the theft are known were perpetrated either by insiders or with the help of insiders; given that the other cases involve bulk material stolen covertly without anyone being aware the material was missing, there is every reason to believe that they were perpetrated by insiders as well. \nThe need is to detect shielded and unshielded Special Nuclear Materials ('SNM') and radioactive materials is necessary. Radiation Monitors are effective to detect unshielded or partially shielded nuclear and radioactive materials in lightly loaded vehicles or cargos, and less effective at dense or high attenuating vehicles. In addition, the radiation monitors are not effective to detect shielding (e.g. lead) inside the vehicles that are capable to transport large masses of shielding material. Specifically, one of the biggest gaps is that some SNMs emit very low level of radiation. The X-ray cannot clear every dense object found in the image. Active interrogation can be used to clear the alarms; however, they produce high radiation that requires shielded facility, and require passengers not to remain in the vehicle during the inspection.  Therefore, there is a need for inspection systems that can penetrate high attenuating vehicles, be specific to nuclear and shielding materials and that can be steal from the sites. . Lingacom is developing an innovative Muon Detection System for detecting high-Z materials used in nuclear bombs and shielded radioactive materials (used in “dirty bombs”) in containerized cargo and vehicles. The company has built a highly skilled and experienced team that has developed and demonstrated successfully key detection capabilities of high-Z materials including building a cost-effective muon detection proof of concept (PoC) prototype.\n'","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/696945","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"200004","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"1032027.0","startDate":"2015-12-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-11-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"329","name":"IMPRODOVA - Improving Frontline Responses to High Impact Domestic Violence","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"In Europe and other Western societies, research findings and policy documents have unearthed an overabundance of recommendations on domestic violence. In theory, we know very well how we should prevent, detect and mitigate domestic violence. However in daily practice this is often not taken into account. Also, there is less research on the factors that escalate family and partner conflict into high impact domestic violence. IMPRODOVA will focus on the police side of the gap between what we know and what we do, but will also include the aspect of police co-operation with other first responders. Why, in practical police work, is domestic violence often regarded as a low priority problem? Why is the reporting rate by victims low? What are the human factors that define effective response and best practice police work in networks of other first line responders, e.g. health practitioners, schools, and youth services?\nPolice frontline responder interviews expanded by fieldwork observation data will be weighed against intermediate and top police leadership expertise collected in the partner LEA's. The influence of human factor variables in frontline operations will be investigated, and the parameters of risk assessment, also of medical practitioners, will be established and compared. Training and study materials with a special focus on scenario-based learning modules will be designed to address the barriers to better domestic violence policing. IMPRODOVA will reach out across the boundaries of first and other relevant responders by disseminating the field research findings to other professionals and representatives of domestic violence prevention and mitigation. A special focus will be laid on the media presentation of domestic violence, since media play an important role how HIDV and its victims are perceived in public.

{"id":"330","name":"IMPROVER - Improved risk evaluation and implementation of resilience concepts to critical infrastructure","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"Large scale crises are affecting critical infrastructures with a growing frequency. This is a result of both basic exposure and dependencies between infrastructures. Because of prohibitive costs, the paradigm of protection against extreme events is expanding and now also encompasses the paradigm of resilience. In addition to strengthening and securing systems; system design objectives are now being set, and response planning is being carried out, to facilitate a fast recovery of infrastructure following a large scale incident. \nWith an interconnected European society, countries and infrastructures are increasingly reliant upon their neighbours, both under normal operating conditions and in the event of an incident. Despite this, there is no common European methodology for measuring resilience or for implementing resilience concepts, and different countries and sectors employ their own techniques. There is also no shared, well-developed system-of-systems approach, which would be able to test the effects of dependencies and interdependencies between individual critical infrastructures and sectors. This increases the risk as a result of reliance on critical infrastructures, as well as affects the ability for sharing resources for incident planning due to no common terminology or means of expressing risk. \nThe overall objective of IMPROVER is to improve European critical infrastructure resilience to crises and disasters through the implementation of combinations of societal, organisational and technological resilience concepts to real life examples of pan-European significance, including cross-border examples. This implementation will be enabled through the development of a methodology based on risk evaluation techniques and informed by a review of the positive impact of different resilience concepts on critical infrastructures. The methodology will be cross sectoral and will provide much needed input to standardisation of security of infrastructure.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653390","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"196889","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"4323978.75","startDate":"2015-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Transboundary crises pose a specific set of complex challenges for which Europe is – despite recent policy initiatives (e.g. Decision No 1313/2013/EU) – still ill prepared. We recognize three challenges that need urgent attention. First, member states need to develop shared response planning. Second, countries need to share information in real time. This sense-making challenge requires a way to have multiple countries and agencies create a shared picture of an emerging crisis based on multiple sources (different countries, many agencies). Third, countries need to coordinate the use of critical resources to ensure a timely response and to avoid waste and misspending. These challenges are hard to meet in any type of crisis or disaster, but especially in a transboundary context that lacks a dominant actor. IN-PREP will establish and demonstrate a next generation programme by  enabling a reference implementation of coordination operations (Handbook of Transboundary Preparedness and Response Operations that synthesises the lessons learnt, recommendations, check-lists from past incidents) and a training platform (Mixed Reality Preparedness Platform a novel IT-based tool, which holistically integrates Information Systems (IS) and Situational Awareness (SA) modules over a decision support mechanism and the visualisation of assets and personnel) to the entirety of civil protection stakeholders (firefighting units, medical emergency services, police forces, civil protection units, control command centres, assessment experts) to meet these challenges.

Recruitment of this new breed of terrorists was done via social media and the Internet. \n\nTo prevent such events from happening in the future and fight radicalization, it is crucial to detect cyberpropaganda early. However, social media providers (e.g. Twitter) admit that at the moment there is no adequate tool to identify terrorist-related content on the Internet. As the result, they are forced to rely on proprietary spam-fighting tools, user reports and human analysis to track down radicalized accounts that promote terrorism.\n \nInsikt Intelligence is a Spanish SME led by the EYIF 2016 Female Web Entrepreneur finalist that developed INSIKT, a novel social data mining platform to detect & defeat violent online radicalization. An early version of INSIKT was validated by several EU law enforcement agencies (LEAs), approved and attracted commercial interest.  This Phase 2 project will trial INSIKT at 4 European LEAs that are looking for effective tools to prevent radical messages from spreading and reaching people vulnerable to radicalization.\n \nINSIKT provides a novel solution for LEA analysts to detect terrorist propaganda on all social media: it identifies radical content, suspicious messages and covert radicalization process with the help of sophisticated text mining algorithms. INSIKT relies on deep learning to develop automatically new models which can be used to detect other criminal activity as well. INSIKT is fit to become an important new tool in LEAs’ investigation and evidence gathering arsenal, giving them highly accurate, multilingual and real-time detection capabilities.\n\nThis project will allow us to improve INSIKT, integrate it with existing LEA tools and commercialize it, addressing the needs of the €60\\B security market, with the effect of creating 50\\ jobs and €11.7M annual revenue within 5 years from market launch.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet;/social sciences/law;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/data mining","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/767542","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"212131","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"1533153.13","startDate":"2017-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

It will enable immediate alert of chemical or biological contaminations and, crucially, indicate not only the location and nature of the hazard, but also the level of risk. This will allow appropriate informed action to be taken and will minimise the chance of false alarms, which not only cost water companies thousands of Euros, but also cause the panic and disruption that are also the aims of terrorist activity\nThe ISIS consortium brings together two water company end-users with security and sensor specialists from the research, academic and SME communities.

The envisaged framework will be based on automated technology for advanced data processing supported by an important human component in critical decision making stages, as well as, legal and ethical aspects. The framework will consist of tools to automatically manipulate, analyse and fuse vast amounts of heterogeneous data acquired from different sources including CCTV surveillance content, confiscated desktops and hard disks, mobile devices, Internet, social networks, handwritten and calligraphic documents. The type of data considered includes text, images, video, audio and biometric information in multiple formats. In order to manage the results of the automated processing, a knowledge repository will be built. It will consider explicit analyst-knowledge and critical legacy information from previous cases. The proposed knowledge representation framework will also allow the system to provide recommendations to analysts, guide the investigation process and perform inference based on evidence extracted from available data.\nIn LASIE, search and retrieval of evidence will be enhanced through the provision of complex query formulations and multimodal search mechanisms yet through a user-friendly, user-centric human-computer interface. The aim is to link and merge heterogeneous data retrieved from multiple sources to improve the knowledge-base and the accuracy of retrieved results. The envisaged user-friendly interface will allow analysts to easily visualise and navigate through the retrieved evidence, highlight relevant events and provide feedback to refine their search criteria.\nLASIE will follow a privacy-by-design approach, ensuring that all the aforementioned functionalities and the used forensic data strictly obey all legal and ethical restrictions and national laws.

Academic understanding of the role of the drugs market in the international economy has increased, but the cumulative impact of counter-narcotics measures in transit chain countries between source and market remain poorly understood, nor are there many comparative studies of the manner that differing illicit drug economies work. These factors remain obstacles to understanding and eliminating the unintended consequences of current counter-narcotic policies, particularly since supply and demand-based counter narcotics measures are separated by the intermediary impact of the geographical 'transit chain' in most cases. This proposal offers the novelty of undertaking a comparative strategic study of two major drug markets, heroin and marijuana, through the prism of the transit chains that currently operate between Afghanistan and the EU and North Africa and the EU respectively, with a view to then evolving a more comprehensive counter-narcotics policy aimed at minimising the proliferation of unintended consequences. The proposal aims to bring this about via a combination of building up an up-to-date strategic model of how these two drugs markets currently operate, conducting interviews with counter-narcotics practicioners and field research in both the source and transit chain countries concerned, and then disseminating this research in the form of concrete policy recommendations via conference activity and publications, including a collection of conference papers and at least one major monograph.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285073","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102364","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"881742.2","startDate":"2012-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Earthquake Induced Liquefaction Disasters (EILDs) is responsible for tremendous amounts of the structural damages and fatalities; with experiences from recent events giving example of where approx. half of the economic loss was directly caused by liquefaction. Liquefaction is a phenomenon, with previously a low profile until recent earthquake events, in which the stiffness and strength of soil is reduced by seismic activity. With the causes of Liquefaction being known, it is important to recognize the factors that contribute to its occurrence; as well as the resulting hazards. The theory on how to address the subject has been comprehensive, as well as the engineering to reduce its consequences of liquefaction already developed; however, recent findings and advances need to be accurately examined in order to implement mitigation strategies practically. A systematic approach is needed for assessing the possibility of liquefaction on a site, prior to construction, then implementing the most appropriate liquefaction mitigation techniques. However, the variability of circumstances, invariably translates to multiple approaches of implementation, based on the susceptibility of the location to liquefaction, as well as the type and size of structure. The LIQUEFACT project addresses the mitigation of risks to EILD events in European communities with a holistic approach. The project not only deals with the resistance of structures to EILD events, but also, the resilience of the collective urban community in relation to their quick recovery from an occurrence. The LIQUEFACT project sets out to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of EILDs, the applications of the mitigation techniques, and the development of more appropriate techniques tailored to each specific scenario, for both Europe and global.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700748","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202709","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"4944072.5","startDate":"2016-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The usage of HME in the 2005 attacks in the London Underground is a frightening example. Our capability to deal with this threat is challenged by the terrorists’ capability to easily manufacture explosives from common components. LOTUS will address the critical issue of detecting bomb (and drugs) factories. The concept and objectives of the LOTUS project are to create a system by which illicit production of explosives and drugs can be detected during the preparation and production phase of a terrorist plot. LOTUS provides intelligence of a sort that is otherwise not available. This intelligence covers a gap where little information is available from other sources. Detection in this phase has advantages compared to detection of the explosives themselves during e.g. the transportation phase. The LOTUS project main activities are measurement of the dispersion of pre-cursors at production and surveillance system development. The system capability will be demonstrated by adapting existing and emerging sensors for detection of selected precursors, and integrating the sensors in a networked system. By using existing global infrastructures for positioning (GPS) and networking (GSM) the LOTUS system can be used more or less anywhere in the world with small costs for supporting installations and personnel. The final outcome of the LOTUS project is a field test and demonstration. The demonstration system will be based on mobile sensors (3-5) mounted in law enforcement vehicles. Findings from the sensors (type and amount of substance, position and time) are automatically sent to an operations centre display unit where data is collected and evaluated for further action.

Liquid contamination in pipelines is a serious issue for safety, security, reliability of supply and commercially for gas supply and transportation companies. Existing technology is designed only to analyse dry gas. Liquid contamination damages the analysers and sample systems and there is no indication of the quantity of liquid present. Early detection of contamination is key and will result in the issue being dealt with before it becomes a commercial problem and most importantly an urgent safety or security issue.\n\nThe Linevu system introduces a non-intruding vision system at various points in the pipeline in order to determine if a liquid is present in the pipeline, so that the correct course of action can be decided upon before it becomes a serious issue.\n\nOur goal is to embark on a phase 2 project in order to bring to market a novel pressurised window, containment system and vision system which can confirm the presence of liquid, while not interfering with routine “pigging” maintenance in the pipeline. The safety, economic and social benefits are numerous and the system would be retro-fitted onto any existing pipelines in the global supply network.\n\nAt a time of great change in the global energy industry in terms of changing sources of gas and security of energy supply, we believe that this innovative technology will provide the EU with a real competitive advantage in the global energy supply market and oil & gas multinationals such as Exxon, Statoil, BP and Shell have already shown great interest in the concept.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/663815","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"196928","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2015-03-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

When accessing a sensitive application on e.g. a mobile device, the user is asked to say or mouth a random challenge phrase which is displayed on screen. The system provides secure user authentication AND verifies 'liveness' to ensure that the system is not being 'spoofed' - a common weakness with most biometric techniques.\n\nIn 2015 Liopa Limited was formed as the commercial vehicle to onward develop and productise this technology. This feasibility study aims to do a detailed study of the market for biometric authentication systems, determine market requirements and potential market verticals, demonstrate an early version of the technology to a prospective customers in their environment, and product a high level business plan for the development and market introduction of a commercial product.'","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/network security;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/cryptography;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/728649","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"204581","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2016-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"384","name":"LocationWise - LocationWise Payment Card Validation: A cloud based location verification system that willsignificantly lower cost of payment card cyber security","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"The vision of LocationWise project is to lower fraud costs incurred by banks from €1.03 to €0.55 per transaction and thus saving Europe ca. €456 million annually. Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. €1.44 billion annually and €14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to €13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user’s mobile device to determine his/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%. Among other things, the purpose of Feasibility Study is to better understand the target market, determine optimum platform resources required to handle a given volume of transactions and to further refine IP strategy.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/information engineering/telecommunications/mobile phone","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/761947","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"208763","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2017-03-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

These needs have been identified after consulting with eleven different European LEAs –members of the MAGNETO consortium. In response, MAGNETO empowers LEAs with superior crime analysis, prevention and investigation capabilities, by researching and providing tailored solutions and tools based on sophisticated knowledge representation, advanced semantic reasoning and augmented intelligence, well integrated in a common, modular platform with open interfaces. By using the MAGNETO platform, LEAs will have unparalleled abilities to fuse and analyse multiple massive heterogeneous data sources, uncover hidden relationships among data items, compute trends for the evolution of security incidents, ultimately (and at a faster pace) reaching solid evidence that can be used in Court, gaining also better awareness and understanding of current or past security-related situations. In parallel, MAGNETO will spark an ecosystem of third-party solution providers benefiting from its open, modular and reusable architectural framework and standard interfaces.\nTo achieve these objectives, MAGNETO will test and demonstrate its developments on five representative and complementary use cases (types of crime), under real-life operational conditions in the facilities of eleven different LEAs, keeping them continuously in the production loop, adopting an agile implementation methodology and a multi-disciplinary scientific approach, combining researchers with exceptional track records, officers with top-level operational know-how in law enforcement, recognised experts for legal and ethical compliance to EU and national standards, and qualified training experts for innovative curricula development.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/humanities/arts/modern and contemporary art/radio and television;/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786629","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"216142","payments":"23","beneficiaries":"23","total_amount":"5320475.0","startDate":"2018-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2021-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"386","name":"MARGIN - Tackle Insecurity in Marginalized Areas","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"The MARGIN project coordination activities are intended to contribute to the creation of sustainable modes of cooperation between stakeholders dealing with security issues. The project provides policy makers with evidence-based tools for developing and assessing strategies targeted at the reduction of insecurity among different demographic and socioeconomic groups. It sets up an international environment for knowledge exchange involving some of the leading EU institutions in Crime Victimization Surveys (CVSs). Along with police statistics, CVSs have become an internationally recognized tool for identifying and analysing factors affecting public and personal perceptions of insecurity. Perception of insecurity arises as a very heterogeneous concept not limited to actual crime rates but encompassing a wide range of other aspects including personal wellbeing, trust in public institutions, justice and social integration. MARGIN addresses the topic of insecurity by taking into account its heterogeneity. Based on previous and on-going research activities, the project's specific aims are: (1) to create a framework enabling end-users to contrast objective and subjective measures of insecurity (i.e. compare police statistics with CVS data), (2) to develop and validate a thematic survey with a sample of 15.400 citizens that allows for the assessment of the impact of demographic, socio-economic and socio-geographic variables on the perception of insecurity (3) to investigate the socio-cultural determinants of insecurity perception through the implementation of anthropological fieldwork in five EU countries (4) to share best practices and outcomes in a final event with 100 key end-users. By deepening the understanding of the root causes of insecurity, MARGIN is expected to foster the creation of community resilience practices empowering citizens (especially among those at risk of exclusion) to better face risks and increase the public and personal perception of security.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653004","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194828","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"1881399.5","startDate":"2015-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Securing the sea requires a day-to-day collaboration activities among European actors of maritime surveillance, Member States’ administrations and European agencies principally, and a significant number of initiatives are being taken at EU level to address this challenge. The large amount of ‘raw data’ available today are not usable by systems supporting maritime security since they are not accessible at the same time and, often, they are not interoperable. Therefore, the overarching goal of MARISA project is to provide the security communities operating at sea with a data fusion toolkit, which makes available a suite of methods, techniques and modules to correlate and fuse various heterogeneous and homogeneous data and information from different sources, including Internet and social networks, with the aim to improve information exchange, situational awareness, decision-making and reaction capabilities. The proposed solution will provide mechanisms to get insights from any big data source, perform analysis of a variety of data based on geographical and spatial representation, use techniques to search for typical and new patterns that identify possible connections between events, explore predictive analysis models to represent the effect of relationships of observed object at sea. Enterprise and ad-hoc reporting and services, within the CISE context, will be provided to support users and operational systems in their daily activities, as well as presentation tools for navigating and visualizing results of data fusion processing.

The good comprises using social media for problem solving, fighting crime, decreasing fear of crime and increasing the quality of life. The bad is the increase of digitised criminality and terrorism with new phenomena emerging through the use of social media. The ugly comprises the grey areas where trolling, cyberbullying, threats, or live video-sharing of tactical security operations are phenomena to deal with during incidents. Making use of the possibilities that social media offer, including smart ‘work-arounds’ is key, while respecting privacy, legislation, and ethics. This changing situation raises a series of challenges and possibilities for public security planners. MEDI@4SEC will explore this through a series of communication and dissemination activities that engage extensively with a range of end-users to better understand the usage of social media for security activities. MEDI@4SEC will seek a better understanding of how social media can, and how social media cannot be used for public security purposes and highlight ethical, legal and data-protection-related issues and implications. Activities centre around six relevant themes: DIY Policing; Everyday security; Riots and mass gatherings: The dark web; Trolling; and Innovative market solutions. MEDI@4SEC will feed into, support and influence changes in policy-making and policy implementation in public security that can be used by end-users to improve their decision making. By structuring our understanding of the impact of social media on public security approaches in a user-friendly way MEDI@4SEC will provide an evidence-base and roadmap for better policymaking including: best practice reports; a catalogue of social media technologies; recommendations for EU standards; future training options; and, ethical awareness raising.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/humanities/philosophy, ethics and religion/ethics","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700281","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"204503","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"1902006.25","startDate":"2016-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Automated processes for DNA analysis of large numbers of samples are now used in many of the EU member states; however the most efficient of these high throughput systems can take 3-5 days to produce DNA database-compliant profiles. In high profile crime and terrorism cases it is crucial to access DNA results promptly to provide intelligence to investigators. Currently a small number of samples can be processed in less than 24 h but the method is labour intensive and expensive. MiDAS proposes a real-time, simple-to-operate and cost effective alternative. MiDAS will build on the current expertise of the consortium to deliver a robust, reliable instrument adaptable to the needs of multiple EU agencies. The design will allow processing of small numbers of samples at the scene of a crime, in an office environment or in the laboratory. Samples will be directly introduced to the device; no further manual involvement will be required. DNA will be extracted using magnetic bead technology and transferred to reaction chambers for quantification and amplification which will be controlled to normalise the DNA profile. The profile will be visualised following analysis through on-cartridge DNA separation and laser induced fluorescence–based detection. Automated data analysis using expert systems will facilitate the timely delivery of a profile. The requirements for implementation of the instrument into the forensic process will be determined, including an evaluation of relevant legislative and data protection requirements.

To maximize the detection capability for SNM the project will develop new detectors for fast and thermal neutrons, as well as gamma-rays, based on the technology of high pressure scintillation cells using noble gases (as 4-He and Xe) recently developed by ARKTIS. The proof-of-principle of the new detectors has already been recently demonstrated. The project’s goal is to deliver a tested prototype of a modular mobile system capable of passively detecting weak or shielded radioactive sources with accuracy higher than that of currently available systems. The identification of the gamma-ray emitter is also possible by using the spectroscopic analysis performed by high pressure Xe cells whereas the ratio between fast and thermal neutrons will bring information about the eventual shielding around the source. The R&D  aims at improve the current detectors  (i.e. at designing, constructing and testing robust, safe, and lightweight high pressure cells with an advanced read-out system) so that they can be used as basic components of the modular mobile system. A suitable Information System will be also developed to manage the detectors, integrate and analyze the data, and provide to the user simple information derived by a decision tree utilizing the data from the three types of detectors. The prototype detection system is the major deliverable of the project.

While tokens can still be stolen or transferred to other persons, biometrics technology can provide reliable, cost-effective and user-friendly solutions.\nThe proliferation of smart services calls for unsupervised authentication at a distance. Being natural, non-intrusive and readily compatible with smart and mobile devices, automatic speaker verification (ASV) is an appealing solution. Even so, today’s state-of-the-art ASV systems lack robustness to environmental variability and are vulnerable to spoofing. Concerns regarding interoperability, scalability and privacy also form barriers to exploitation.\nWhile embracing standards, in addition to a privacy and interoperability-by-design ethos, OCTAVE will integrate commercial-grade and new, hybrid ASV systems with the latest environmental robustness and anti-spoofing technologies to deliver a scalable, trusted biometric authentication service (TBAS). While simultaneously relieving end-users from the inconvenience of dealing with textual passwords, the OCTAVE platform will reduce the economic and practical burdens related to password loss and recovery. The TBAS will support single (text-dependent, text-prompted and text-independent) in addition to hybrid operating modes. The delegation of authentication to a single, yet distributed TBAS, will increase trust and privacy, avoid single points of failure and allow for rapid breach notification and remediation.\nSolutions will be installed in data-sensitive and mission-critical services and validated in two real commercial trials: banking services and physical access within a critical airport infrastructure. Flexibility will support wider exploitation in future applications in, for example, customer care, telephone banking, e-commerce, logical and physical access control. OCTAVE will thus fuel new opportunities for commercial services making use of electronic identification and authentication.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/access control;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce/e-commerce","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/647850","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194511","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"4406116.0","startDate":"2015-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-07-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Indeed, if users are strongly identified during a transaction, then privacy is non-existent. Nevertheless, there exist mechanisms that can reconcile privacy and strong identity, either by trusting an online identity provider (IDP), or by using cryptographic mechanisms such as anonymous credentials.\n \nThe former approach, made popular by technologies such as SAML, OpenID Connect, and Facebook Connect, has the disadvantage that the IDP forms a single point of failure in terms of privacy and security, because it can impersonate and track its users online. The latter approach has the disadvantage that users have to rely on trusted hardware such as smartcards to protect credentials from compromise and from illegitimate sharing.\n \nOLYMPUS will take a radically new approach offering the seamless user experience of online IDPs, but without their drawbacks. Namely, OLYMPUS will pioneer the concept of distributed oblivious identity management, where the role of the IDP is split over multiple authorities, so that no single authority can track or impersonate their users. By exploiting advanced techniques based on threshold cryptography, the OLYMPUS framework will let users maintain unlinkable identities with different service providers while using standard devices and a single password or biometric.\n \nBy leveraging existing eID solutions to create a strong link to physical identities, and by integrating into existing frameworks to ease adoption by service providers, OLYMPUS will establish a secure and interoperable European identity management framework. Its practical feasibility and relevance will be demonstrated in two pilots. The first combines the framework with soft identity proofs to build a mobile driver license application that can be used for offline purchases of restricted goods.

Security forces demand new tools to fight against this threat and the industry is making a big effort in the last few years to provide such tools. Every year a number of new products to detect and identify concealed explosives reach the market but up to the moment these new systems do not meet the full operational capabilities demanded by the end users.  Probably the most demanded by the end users is the capability for standoff detection and identification of explosives, in order to be able to anticipate the threat from a safe distance and to avoid entering into the lethality area of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). Such standoff detection capability is also very demanded for intelligence operations to identify materials, people or places involved in the preparation and transportation of explosives.  In order to meet the end user’s needs, OPTIX will develop of a transportable system for the standoff detection and identification of explosives in real scenarios at distances of around 20 m (sensor to target), using alternative or simultaneous analysis of three different complementary optical technologies (LIBS, RAMAN, IR) and with the following characteristics:\n• Standoff distance of at least 20 m.\n• Detection of explosives in bulk, trace amounts and even liquids in certain conditions.\n• Very fast detection and identification of explosives\n• Very high specificity for the identification of explosives.\n• Large operational availability of the system.\n• Fully automated decision system (no operator dependence).\nIn order to be successful, end user’s involvement in OPTIX is essential in the system specifications and validation, and in this sense the OPTIX consortium has put a special effort in including end users in those parts of the project where their contribution is relevant.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/218037","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"88604","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"9","total_amount":"2487556.0","startDate":"2008-11-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The underlying idea of ORIGINS is to improve the security and therefore to restore the confidence in the application process and issuance of e-passports, by filling the gaps in security of breeder documents. Indeed, while some assurance approaches have been implemented in a few countries, they remain insufficient to provide breeder documents in complete security and trustworthiness at a time when this is increasingly necessary.\nThis project will therefore investigate exhaustively the current state of passport breeder documents requirements and issuing practices in Member States/Associated Countries. The identification of common security gaps will lead to the recommendation of possible solutions to overcome the security weaknesses in breeder documents. The project will provide support for issuance bodies and border control communities. It will also promote the standardisation of breeder documents by creating a dedicated working group at a European level.\nThese objectives will be achieved through the establishment of a strong networking environment between key actors in the sector (passport breeder document and e-passport communities, border control community, ministries, industry, SMEs, universities, NGOs, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, …), exchange and dissemination of good practices between relevant communities, the definition and organisation of joint or common initiatives, meetings, conferences, events and with an appropriate management of the action. Broad communication and dissemination actions will be undertaken throughout the project lifecycle. At the same time, it is expected that ORIGINS’ results will continue to live beyond the end of the project, in particular via think-tank groups built during the project, standardisation groups and the implementation of ORIGINS’ recommendations.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/political science/government systems/nongovernmental organization","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607663","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"192602","payments":"15","beneficiaries":"15","total_amount":"1727362.71","startDate":"2014-12-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-07-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"442","name":"PANDORA - Advanced Training Environment for Crisis Scenarios","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"Crisis management is a major issue to prevent emergency situations from turning into disasters. In last years a not correct management of emergencies often created critical situations. In the happening of a catastrophic event, it is human behaviour-- and often human behaviour alone--that determines the speed and efficacy of the crisis management efforts. Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise. Table top exercises are low cost and can be easily and frequently organized, but it cannot recreate the real atmosphere, (e.g. stress, confusion) and need to keep critical decisions in very little time. On the other hand, crisis managers trained through simulation exercises on the field can be very effective, but such a simulations are very expensive and cannot be easily and quickly organized. PANDORA will bridge the gap between table-top exercises and real world simulation exercises, providing a near-real training environment at affordable cost. In a real-time, physics-based environment, PANDORA authentically simulates all the dynamic elements of the entire disaster environment. PANDORA will emulate a complete crisis room: realistic 3D visuals and audio create a truly immersive, chaotic and stressful environment. PANDORA realistically responds to actions taken to enable real individual training value and the development of complete skill sets. Pandora will train at all levels of response, from management and control to all the on-scene activities for emergency organizations. Furthermore, different crisis room will be able to interact, thus recreating a near-real interconnected cross-borders environment.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/225387","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"93363","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"9","total_amount":"2930000.0","startDate":"2010-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2012-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The image or idea of a “promised land”, however, might not be real, and newcomers are often faced with obstacles and challenges. Certain narratives and perceptions of Europe influence migration aspirations and false images can not only lead to problems when the image does not hold true, but it might also even lead to security threats, risks or radicalisation. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to understand and investigate narratives about Europe, how these can lead to problems and threats, how they are distributed, and, in a next step, find ways to react and counteract on them. Perceptions on Europe are formed in the country of residence, and they are based on a multitude of sources. Social media and new communication networks, in addition, have increased the scope and the intensity of distribution of such narratives; and furthermore, so-called filter bubbles and echo chambers can lead to isolated misperceptions that are not corrected. Due to new communication technologies, false or incorrect claims become life on their own, raise expectations or disapproval. At the same time, however, these technologies and communication networks might also provide a channel to set an exaggerated image straight and to promote a more realistic narrative. It is, therefore, the aim of the PERCEPTIONS project to identify and understand the narratives and (mis-)perceptions of the EU abroad, assess potential issues related with the border and external security in order to allow better planning and outline reactions and countermeasures. For that purpose, the project will conduct research on the narratives and the myths that are circulating about the EU in countries West- and Central Mediterranean area.

PLACARD’s approach to achieving these goals is to establish a strong and operational network of networks by connecting to existing networks and boundary organisations, to foster dialogue among stakeholders (e.g. researchers, research funders, policymakers, practitioners) engaged in CCA and DRR at the international, European, national and sub-national scales. This overarching network will enable these communities to share knowledge, to discuss challenges and to jointly co-produce options to bridge the gaps they experience. It will support the development and implementation of a research and innovation agenda to make better use of research funding, as well as to develop guidelines to strengthen relevant institutions in their efforts to mainstream CCA and DRR. PLACARD will evolve iteratively, learning from the different processes and experiences with the stakeholders, and being flexible and responsive to changing needs.

If the perpetrator’s objectives can be met solely through the creation of human illness, death and associated panic, this may be appropriate. However, if economic and political vulnerabilities are included as contributing factors, agricultural bioterrorism must be considered among other possible avenues of attack.\nAgricultural bioterrorism (agroterrorism) is a subset of bioterrorism, and it is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease/pest with the goal of generating fear, causing economic losses, and/or undermining stability.\nProgrammes preparing for attacks against agriculture are not new, and have been conducted both by nation-states and by substate organizations throughout history. At least nine countries (Canada, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, USA and the former USSR) had documented agricultural bioweapons programmes during some part of the 20th century. Four other countries (Egypt, North Korea, Rhodesia and Syria) are believed to have or have had agricultural bioweapons programmes.\nIn the mean time, natural outbreaks of diseases demonstrate the destructive potential of an agroterroristic attack.\nRecent trends in biosecurity recommend a shift from a largely national approach to biosecurity towards greater international cooperation. Current capabilities to detect and respond to agroterrorism are limited and spread among many organizations, with a corresponding lack of coordination.\nThe project deals with threats which are multifaceted, interrelated, complex and increasingly transnational in their impact. The European Network of Excellence PLANTFOODSEC aims to establish a virtual Centre of Competence in plant and food biosecurity to enhance preparedness and response capabilities to prevent, to respond and to recover from a biological incident or deliberate criminal activity threatening the European agrifood system.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/agricultural sciences/agriculture, forestry, and fisheries;/agricultural sciences/agriculture, forestry, and fisheries/agriculture;/humanities/history and archaeology/history","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261752","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"100052","payments":"14","beneficiaries":"14","total_amount":"4624499.0","startDate":"2011-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

For the purpose of our proposal, NIIS are X-ray systems deployed to inspect all types of parcels, baggage, cargo, vehicles, containers, and trains, in a non-intrusive manner. \nOver the past 10 years Danlex has realised sales of NIIS equipment and NIIS maintenance services totalling more than EUR 40 million in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Kosovo. Airports, customs administrations, border police, harbours, and other authorities responsible for protecting the freedom and security of societies worldwide (security organisations) in the European Union and worldwide have been charged with: preventing global terrorist threats and illegal human trafficking; detecting and identifying illicit or undeclared goods; increasing security to the global supply chain. To tackle these challenges security organisations have increasingly been utilising NIIS equipment over the last two decades, as the most effective equipment for fulfilling their duties in compliance with the applicable regulations and standards. \nWith the average NIIS lifespan of 10 years the maintenance has proved to be high and lead to much higher than anticipated running costs over the equipment’s lifetime, totalling to 100% of NIIS purchase price. To ensure value for money, it is important that NIIS operate with maximum efficiency and at the lowest possible level of maintenance and life-cycle costs. NIIS maintenance solution enabled by PMT (PMT4NIIS) will allow us to equip the security organisations and market stakeholders with the next generation of NIIS maintenance. Independent reports estimate that with reliability-centered maintenance powered by predictive models, stakeholders in other markets spend 15% of their overall maintenance time on Predictive Maintenance, yet achieve an impressive 50% decrease in maintenance costs.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/criminology","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/790798","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213293","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2018-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

At the very early response stages voice communications are critical, after which non-voice communications are an important requirement dependent on the nature of the disaster.\nAs most mobile telecommunications networks located in a disaster area are designed to support normal traffic loads, they will not have the capacity to provide effective PPDR communications. As disasters require effective co-ordination, support and communication between all agencies involved, it would be ideal if one communication solution could be provided to meet all needs.  Radio communications networks used by public safety and the emergency services will normally be used to provide Public Protection.  Most public safety organisations have the capability to rapidly deploy mobile communications network elements to provide additional capacity and/or maintain communications if the main network fails. As the trend in parts of Europe is to allow non-public safety organisations that could be involved in major emergencies and disasters to operate on the same networks as used by public safety organisations, it is reasonable that provision could be made on these networks to Disaster Relief (DR) agencies.\nThe goal of PPDR-TC is to specify an interoperable, secure and resilient voice and data communications architecture, tailored specifically for the needs of the PPDR community. It will provide the foundation for the evolution of mission critical communications. PPDR-TC will address both mission critical and non-mission critical situations in an integrated and uniform way.

PREVAIL will address these scientific challenges by a novel approach. The PREVAIL concept and objectives are to prevent the use of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and acetone as precursors to homemade explosives by the development of a series of novel inhibitors, and to ensure that the detection of ammonium nitrate (AN) based devices is facilitated by adding markers tailored to a very sensitive detection system. These objectives must be met without obstructing the legitimate use or causing any adverse effects on the environment or people’s health. The PREVAIL project main activities are development and testing of markers for the inhibition of TATP production and for the concentration of HP by boiling off water (as was done for the London bombings) as well as development of novel markers for easy detection of illicit use of fertilizers. The final outcome of the PREVAIL project are inhibitors for illicit production of TATP and HP based explosives as well as novel marker/detector systems for easy detection of AN based bombs. The PREVAIL project will work together with the chemical manufacturing industry in order to achieve early industrial acceptance of the research. The PREVAIL consortium consists of four research institutes (FOI, TNO,CEA, WIHiE), two chemical industries representing the End Users (Yara, Arkema), three SMEs (Inscentinel, KCEM, SECRAB) and one university (Technion).","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/chemical sciences/inorganic chemistry/inorganic compounds","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/241858","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"95604","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"3343162.0","startDate":"2010-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

This focus is shared, from the start, by 22 organisations from 10 countries, public transport operators, security forces, public buyers, city authorities of which 12 are consortium partners and 10 are members of the PREVENT User Observatory Group (UOG). PREVENT implements a progressive and iterative process to deliver 6 jointly defined Common Security Scenarios that capture threats and vulnerabilities. It also delivers a vulnerabilities and threats taxonomy directly applicable to the public transport world. For these scenarios, PREVENT undertakes a gap analysis between available solutions, existing standards, on-going research and identified needs, from which it elaborates a multi-dimensional roadmap of innovations and solutions. The roadmap is an online interactive tool that feeds the sustainability of PREVENT’s community. The highest priority innovations in the roadmap are selected by practitioners and public buyers to define a Common Challenge. This Common Challenge serves as the basis for a PCP, for which the buyers’ group is created, the lead buyer is selected, tender documents are generated. PREVENT includes a governance mechanism that ensures that the different phases are open to additional practitioners and public buyers. PREVENT includes a Security Advisory Board to manage the confidentiality of the sensitive knowledge generated by its activities, and a GDPR advisor to guide the elaboration of a Common Challenge fully compliant with Europe’s privacy and data protection regulations. PREVENT structures its governance and results (public and confidential) to foster sustainability of the collaboration beyond the end of the project.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance;/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development;/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection;/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport/public transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833444","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"222624","payments":"16","beneficiaries":"16","total_amount":"1894305.0","startDate":"2019-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-07-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

They facilitate trustworthy trades and exchanges over the Internet, power cryptocurrencies, ensure transparency for documents, and much more.\nAlthough based on cryptographic techniques at their core, the currently deployed DLTs do not address privacy. Indeed, the very idea of a public ledger that stores a verifiable record of transactions at first appears inherently incompatible with the privacy requirements of many potential applications, which use sensitive data such as trade secrets and personal information. New cryptographic techniques and protocols are therefore needed to protect the data, facilitate these applications, and make DLTs deliver on their promises.\nPRIViLEDGE realises cryptographic protocols supporting privacy, anonymity, and efficient decentralised consensus for DLTs. In PRIViLEDGE, several European key players in cryptographic research and from the fintech and blockchain domains unite to push the limits of cryptographic protocols for privacy and security. Results from PRIViLEDGE are demonstrated through four ledger-based solutions: (1) verifiable online voting; (2) contract validation and execution for insurance; (3) university diploma record ledger; and (4) update mechanism for stake-based ledgers. The selected use cases are diverse and represent the principal application domains of DLT; this ensures wide reach and impact of the techniques developed in PRIViLEDGE beyond the immediate scope of the project.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/780477","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213144","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"4527917.5","startDate":"2018-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2021-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The project also connects national customs risk management systems to logistics Big Data of INTTRA and the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and provides customs an improved access to online data, especially valuation-relevant data of e-commerce sites. PROFILE also strengthens cooperation and data exchange among customs and other competent authorities. Better access to data, customised state-of-the-art data analytics, and stronger cooperation will provide the customs an enhanced 360º view on cross-border cargo flows.

They will combine high use-value with a strong European perspective, paving the way towards an integrated European approach. Since serious and organised tax crimes often involve cross-border activities, requiring cooperation across national jurisdictions a shared understanding of risks, threats and security measures will improve European law enforcement practices. PROTAX will produce innovative solutions boosting evolutionary development towards a genuine and sustainable European approach, significantly reducing the damages for European societies caused by criminals in the financial sector.\nPROTAX adopts a five-pronged approach. 1. We use case studies of tax crimes to investigate the roles of various actors. 2. We conduct focus groups with stakeholders in Member States. 3. We focus on the role of professional enablers as facilitators allowing illicit financial flows through legitimate institutions. 4.We map out various legal and enforcement approaches across the EU. 5. We make recommendations and provide a toolkit improving prevention of tax crimes and enforcement of the law. \nPROTAX will involve experts from LEAs and tax authorities in structured exchanges to share experience and ideas. A focus will be on cross-border aspects, assuming that tax crimes spread from “source countries” across the EU (e.g., to tax havens).

The system will be deployed in Automated Border Control (ABC) areas supporting border guards to facilitate smooth and non-intrusive rapid crossing by travellers based on deployment of the next generation of biometric identification detection methods. The ability for the system to efficiently process low-risk travellers, combined with increased levels of accuracy, security and privacy standards and enabling border guards to concentrate resource on higher-risk travellers, are central ambitions of the project.  To achieve these goals, a multi-biometric enrollment and verification system is envisaged, taking into account current and next-generation e-Passport chips, mobile equipment and person identification ‘on the move’. Research will be undertaken into optimization of currently deployed biometric modalities, application of emerging biometrics (including contactless finger vein, speaker recognition and angthropometrics), multi-modal biometrics and counter-spoofing, for border control scenarios.  An integral part of the project is collection and dissemination of new border-realistic biometric datasets, and systematic evaluation of the developed biometric methods including vulnerability and privacy assessment.  The PROTECT project is strongly user-driven and demonstration of the developed biometric system will be conducted at two different border crossing sites.

PROTECTIVE makes two key contributions to achieve this enhanced situational awareness. Firstly it increases the computer security incident response team’s (CSIRT) threat awareness through improved security monitoring and increased sharing of threat intelligence between organisations within a community. Secondly it ranks critical alerts based on the potential damage the attack can inflict on the threatened assets and hence to the organisations business. High impact alerts that target important hosts will have a higher priority than other alerts. Through the combination of these two measures organisations are better prepared to handle incoming attacks, malware outbreaks and other security problems and to guide the development of the prevention and remediation processes.\nThe PROTECTIVE system is designed to provide solutions for public domain CSIRTs and SME’s who both have needs outside the mainstream of cyber security solution provision. Public CSIRTs needs arise in part because commercial tools do not address their unique requirements. This has created a shortfall, clearly articulated by ENISA, of tools with the required analytical and visualisation capabilities to enable public CSIRTs provide optimised services to their constituency. SME’s also are vulnerable to cybercrime as they have limited resources to protect themselves and often a limited understanding of what needs to be done. Two pilots will be conducted to evaluate and validate the PROTECTIVE outcomes with CSIRTs from 3 National Research and Educational Networks (NRENs) and with SMEs via a managed security service provider (MSSP). \nThe PROTECTIVE consortium is constituted of 3 NRENs, 3 academic and four commercial partners from 8 countries so as to maximise the technical and commercial impact of the outputs and the dissemination and uptake of the results.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/malicious software;/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700071","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202674","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"4160596.88","startDate":"2016-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The proposed PROTECTRAIL approach is therefore to split the problem of making the railway more secure into smaller asset-specific security problems (missions) for which it is easier to reach satisfactory solutions applicable and usable in different threat scenarios. Each sub-mission could be therefore better oriented to particularly significant areas of interest, resulting from risk analysis or from rail operator priorities. In a clear view of scope and performance goals, for each sub mission it will be easier to define, research and develop solutions in terms of architectures, technology deployment, as well as the necessary procedures, organizations to manage the specific issue. The PROTECTRAIL challenge is therefore to make interoperable the single asset-specific solutions and to conceive and design a modular architectural framework where each asset-specific solution can be “plugged”, that is the basis to assure a streamlined process of federation, integration and interoperability of respective solutions. The PROTECTRAIL project will address the following security sub-missions: protection of signal and power distribution systems against any terrorism act, track clearance, clearance of trains before and after daily use, staff clearance, luggage clearance control, passenger clearance control, freight clearance control, tracking and monitoring of rolling stock carrying dangerous goods, protection of communication and information systems, stations, buildings and infrastructure protection.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242270","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"95607","payments":"32","beneficiaries":"31","total_amount":"15729878.0","startDate":"2010-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Cyber attacks are made mostly against governments and corporates to gather guarded information, or to disrupt their operation in general. Advanced attackers targeted 5 out of 6 large companies each month in 2014, whereas 60% of all targeted attacks struck small- and medium-sized organisations. The same year companies across all industries worldwide have reported a total of 42.8 million detected\nattacks. And the consequences are varied and serious: crime involving computers and networks has cost the world economy more than $445 billion annually and the cost is expected to reach 1 trillion in 2016. Restroring damages caused by successful cyber attacks is extremely difficult and costly, if not impossible. Moreover, when a security breach occurs, the company or organisation concerned not only loses valuable and/or sensitive data, but it also suffers damage to its brand and reputation that can take a lot of time and money to repair. The increasing cybercrime urges for innovative cyber security solutions that are able to detect and immediately respond to attacks that are highly sophisticated and damaging, which is more important than ever. And this phenomena generates market opportunity for cybersecurity specialty companies. At ReaQta we develop the next generation cyber security protection solution –ReaQta-core - that can revolutionise the IT security market by offering a higher level of protection to governments and private organisations.

Understanding the behavioural and developmental aspects of cyber criminality is becoming increasingly important and underlies the necessity of a shift in focus from sanctions to deterrence and prevention.\n\nAs a research project, RAYUELA aims to bring together law enforcement agencies (LEAs), sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, legal experts, computer scientists and engineers, to develop novel methodologies that allow better understanding the factors affecting online behaviour related to new ways of cyber criminality, as well as promoting the potential of these young talents for cybersecurity and technologies.\n\nRAYUELA’s main goal is to better understand the drivers and human factors affecting certain relevant ways of cybercriminality, as well as empower and educate young people (children and teenagers primarily) in the benefits, risks and threats intrinsically linked to the use of the Internet by playing, thus preventing and mitigating cybercriminal behaviour.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/882828","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"229109","payments":"17","beneficiaries":"17","total_amount":"4974290.0","startDate":"2020-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2023-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"505","name":"REACT - REactively Defending against Advanced Cybersecurity Threats","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"Security is a vital property for every operational system and network. As systems become more powerful and, in many aspects, more complex, advanced cyber-attacks impose new threats for important operations of our society. Computer systems assist core functions of hospitals, energy centers, logistics, and communications, to name a few, and compromising such systems may have severe consequences for everyone of us. Despite the evolution of computer systems, current security defenses-although they have been substantially improved in the last decade-seem not really enough to stop advanced cyber attacks. Systems still suffer from vulnerabilities, despite the many active or passive defenses in place that have been developed in the last decades.\n\nWe believe that the core of this problem is that cyber attackers are almost always one step ahead of the cyber security researchers and practitioners. Indeed, cyber attackers are the first to strike, and while researchers try to figure out what happened, attackers have all the time in the world to plan their next strike. In this project we advocate that we should change the rules of the cyber attackers’ game and challenge the asymmetry. Instead of following the cyber attackers, researchers should try to forecast where attackers will strike next and to use this information (i) to fortify potential targets to withstand the attack and (ii) to wire targets up with forensic hooks and make them “forensics ready”. To make all this possible at a reasonable performance cost, we propose selective fortification, a mechanism that combines traditional passive and active defense approaches into a new reactive mode of operation. We take advantage of our rich background in software hardening and instrumentation for immediate delivering effective patches by selectively armoring the vulnerable part of a program.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786669","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"214838","payments":"6","beneficiaries":"6","total_amount":"2726461.25","startDate":"2018-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2021-05-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Whilst cryptography can guarantee many security properties, it crucially depends on the ability to keep the used keys secret even in face of determined adversaries. \nOver the last two decades a new type of adversary has emerged, able to obtain, from the cryptographic implementation, side channel leakage such as recording of response times, power or EM signals, etc. To account for such adversaries, sophisticated security certification and evaluation methods (Common Criteria, EMVCo, FIPS…) have been established to give users assurance that security claims have withstood independent evaluation and testing. Recently the reliability of these evaluations has come into the spotlight: the Taiwanese citizen card proved to be insecure, and Snowden’s revelations about NSA's tampering with FIPS standards eroded public confidence.\nREASSURE will (1) improve the efficiency and quality of all aspects of certification using a novel, structured detect-map-exploit approach that will also improve the comparability of independently conducted evaluations, (2) cater for emerging areas such as the IoT by automating leakage assessment practices in order to allow resistance assessment without immediate access to a testing lab, (3) deliver tools to stakeholders, such as reference data sets and an open-source leakage simulator based on instruction-level profiles for a processor relevant for the IoT, (4) improve existing standards by actively pushing the novel results to standardization bodies.\nREASSURE's consortium is ideal to tackle such ambitious tasks. It features two major circuits manufacturers (NXP, IDEMIA), a highly respected side channel testing lab (Riscure), an engaged governmental representative (ANSSI), and two of the most prominent research institutions in this field (UCL, University of Bristol).","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet/internet of things;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/cryptography","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/731591","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"207201","payments":"8","beneficiaries":"8","total_amount":"3478747.5","startDate":"2017-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

A benefit of this engagement has been the recognition that in addition to agency interoperability of communications a pressing need exists for agency interoperability of additional IT systems such as databases, sensor systems and cameras. REDIRNET provides a framework for addressing this need with detailed mapping of user preferences and related legal requirements using innovative technologies.\n\nThe consortium is aware that frequently it is non-technical issues that hinder agency interoperability regardless of the quality of technical solutions. Consequently user engagement across a range of agencies EU-wide will be ongoing throughout the duration of REDIRNET.  This will lead to the first of two elements of the REDIRNET framework - a quality repository of user identified interoperability issues and proposals for their resolution\nThe second element of REDIRNET will be technology. REDIRNET will provide a decentralized framework for interoperability for first responders’ systems based on a public meta-data gateway controlled by the agencies themselves via a REDIRNET socio-professional web. Agencies will be able link up to partner agencies of their choice and operational need; they will also be able to manage the scope of such interoperability. To help set up these link-up arrangements REDIRNET will be enhanced with semantic web methods in accordance with the vocabulary and processes of the user community.

Furthermore, enhancing resilience in transport systems is considered imperative for two main reasons: such systems provide critical support to every socio-economic activity and are currently themselves one of the most important economic sectors and secondly, the paths that convey people, goods and information, are the same through which risks are propagated. RESOLUTE is answering those needs, by proposing to conduct a systematic review and assessment of the state of the art of the resilience assessment and management concepts, as a basis for the deployment of an European Resilience Management Guide (ERMG), taking into account that resilience is not about the performance of individual system elements but rather the emerging behaviour associated to intra and inter system interactions. The final goal of RESOLUTE is to adapt and adopt the identified concepts and methods from the defined guidelines for their operationalization and evaluation when addressing Critical Infrastructure (CI) of the Urban Transport System (UTS), through the implementation of the RESOLUTE Collaborative Resilience Assessment and Management Support System (CRAMSS), that adopts a highly synergic approach towards the definition of a resilience model for the next-generation of collaborative emergency services and decision making process.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653460","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194870","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"4349456.0","startDate":"2015-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"519","name":"RESPECT - RESPECT – Rules, Expectations & Security through Privacy-Enhanced Convenient Technologies","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"Convenience and cost-effectiveness are the two key considerations for both citizens and security forces when deciding which technologies to embrace or avoid in the Information Society. State actors and private corporations adopt information communication technologies (ICTs) because they are cost-effective. The motivation for adoption may be different in the private and public sectors but once adopted these ICTs are then capable of being bridged in multiple ways permitting police/security forces to go beyond the data they gather directly but also increasingly tap into data gathered and stored by private corporations. These ICTs, which have to date gone through a period of largely organic growth, will be deemed to be “in balance” if they are implemented in a way which respects individual privacy while still maximising convenience, profitability, public safety and security. RESPECT seeks to investigate if the current and foreseeable implementation of ICTs in surveillance is indeed “in balance” and, where a lack of balance may exist or is perceived by citizens not to exist, the project explores options for redressing the balance through a combination of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies and operational approaches. Investigating at least five key sectors not yet tackled by other recent projects researching surveillance (CCTV, database mining and interconnection, on-line social network analysis, RFID & geo-location/sensor devices, financial tracking), RESPECT will also carry out quantitative and qualitative research on citizens’ awareness and attitudes to surveillance. RESPECT will produce tools that would enable policy makers to understand the socio-cultural as well as the operational and economic impact of surveillance systems. The project will also produce operational guidelines incorporating privacy by design approaches which would enable law enforcement agencies to deploy surveillance systems with lowest privacy risk possible and maximum security gain to citizens.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285582","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"104278","payments":"21","beneficiaries":"21","total_amount":"3492690.45","startDate":"2012-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-05-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Attacks, carried out under a national, political, or religious banner, now strike regularly in our cities, causing deaths, damage and disruption on an unprecedented scale. In the past seven years alone, 1300 terrorist incidents have taken place on European soil. The RIBS project will deliver more effective and viable security measures by supporting a design process that integrates a broader understanding of the environment (and the contextual factors such as human elements) within which these measures are meant to be implemented. The particular objectives of the project include: • a set of functional and non-functional requirements that will drive an effective security system design process. • a set of protection measurement techniques that can be used to assess the level of protection offered by candidate security products proposed to be implemented in buildings and infrastructures. This work will be carried out for a range of security systems aimed at securing buildings against hostile reconnaissance, intruders and hazardous attack (including chemical, biological and explosive). The RIBS-project will derive a scientific method for security system engineering design that can be challenged and improved over the years, similarly to other areas of engineering and physical sciences. • Phase 1: Study of a &apos;live&apos; building and its ‘eco-system’, its protection measures, and threats; and integration of these elements into a single multi-layer model. • Phase 2: Identification of vulnerabilities through incident analysis and protection-measures analysis. • Phase 3: Development of design requirements.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business;/natural sciences/physical sciences","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242497","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"96576","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"3321957.8","startDate":"2010-11-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

It can be very problematic when investigations are underway and quick results are needed. Traces must be detected on-site as soon as possible before they degrade and loose forensic information important for criminal investigation. Based on the results of the FORLAB project, the aim of the RISEN project is the development of a set of real-time contactless sensors for the optimization of the trace, detection, visualisation, identification and interpretation on site, with a consequent reduction of the time and resources in the laboratory, and for a fast exchange of information among LEAs.  The new proposed approach could be applied to the classical forensic investigations and to disaster sites, e.g. after a terrorist attack. The objectives of the RISEN project will be obtained by:\n-Developing and demonstrating contactless, non-destructive, automated sensors to identify, select and label trace materials;\n-Processing and sending in real-time acquired in-situ data to a 3D Augmented Crime Scene Investigation system to produce an interactive 3D model of the scene with position and labelling of traces and relative results of the on-site analysis.\nThe recreated 3D model of the scene resorts to augmented reality techniques for sensor data, collected evidence and identified points of interest in order to deliver a realistic and immersive visual environment for investigators, allowing them to conduct highly detailed investigations. The crime scenes, with analytical information from traces, will be digitally frozen to be available at any time for several purposes in the criminal justice system.

Detection of the primer can be essential in order to secure a prosecution, especially if the materials that comprise the main charge are commonly available, e.g., ammonium nitrate is present in fertiliser.\nROSFEN’s goal is to deliver an advanced forensic platform for rapid, on-site direct detection and lab-quality analysis of narcotics, explosives and their precursors. The performance targets are detection limits down to 1 ng/mL, 1% false alarm rate and response time < 10 seconds.\nROSFEN combines innovative technology from two leading SMEs: Microsaic Systems’ chip-based mass spectrometry and Environics’ ion filter systems. This novel platform removes the need for slow, costly chromatography methods currently used in lab-based analysis.

ReCRED adopts an incrementally deployable strategy in two complementary directions: extensibility in the type and nature of supported stakeholders and services (from local access control to online service access), as well as flexibility and extensibility in the set of supported authentication and access control techniques; from widely established and traditional ones to emerging authentication and authorization protocols as well as cryptographically advanced attribute-based access control approaches. Simplicity, usability, and users privacy is accomplished by: i) hiding inside the device all the complexity involved in the aggregation and management of multiple digital identifiers and access control attribute credentials, as well as the relevant interaction with the network infrastructure and with identity consolidation services; ii) integrating in the device support for widespread identity management standards and their necessary extensions; and iii) controlling the exposure of user credentials to third party service providers.

By analyzing the communication activities that followed terror attacks in many different countries, as well as the requirements for effective crisis communications, the project will develop a comprehensive and flexible communication strategy for authorities to react after terror attacks.  The strategy will be disseminated in the form of a crisis communications manual, and series of training modules and complementary audio-visual material.  These deliverables will enable authorities to develop, adapt and enhance their own crisis communication plans for effective reaction in case of terror attacks.  The rapid expansion of global terrorism means that every government office, local authority and organisation is exposed to the threat of a terrorist attack.   Such attacks usually come where least expected, as terrorists become globally mobile and search for vulnerable targets across Europe and other countries.  A terror attack causes loss of life and destruction of facilities but also wider public panic, misunderstanding and fear.  Recovery from a terror attack depends on a carefully planned and effective communications strategy, aimed at three target audiences: the media, the general public and internal employees of the authorities affected by the attack.  Only by preparing beforehand could an authority be assured of an effective counter-terrorism communication strategy that dovetails within wider crisis management and continuity plans.

The sources of these threats have been heterogeneous, as well as weapons to impact the population. As Europeans, we know now that we must increase our awareness against these attacks that can strike the places we rely upon the most and destabilize our institutions remotely. Today, the lines between physical and cyber worlds are increasingly blurred. Nearly everything is connected to the Internet and if not, physical intrusion might rub out the barriers. Threats cannot be analysed solely as physical or cyber, and therefore it is critical to develop an integrated approach in order to fight against such combination of threats. Health services are at the same time among the most critical infrastructures and the most vulnerable ones. They are widely relying on information systems to optimize organization and costs, whereas ethics and privacy constraints severely restrict security controls and thus increase vulnerability. The aim of this proposal is to provide solutions that will improve physical and cyber security in a seamless and cost-effective way. It will promote new technologies and novel approaches to enhance threat prevention, threat detection, incident response and mitigation of impacts. The project will also participate in increasing the compliance between security tools and European regulations about ethics and privacy for health services. Finally, project pilots will take place in the hospitals of Marseille, Turin and Amsterdam, involving security and health practitioners, in order to simulate attack scenarios in near-real conditions. These pilot sites will serve as reference examples to disseminate the results and find customers across Europe.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/humanities/philosophy, ethics and religion/ethics;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/787002","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"214348","payments":"22","beneficiaries":"22","total_amount":"7994553.63","startDate":"2018-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2021-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

The platform will also include performance measurement tools based on safety goals (people and infrastructure damage) to measure the skills of the analyst.\n\nAll the simulations will be stored in a database for further analysis, creating a large set of data that can be exploited. The database will work as an historic repository, but more interestingly, as a large set of useful data that will be re-analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms to create predictive models. The main goal of this predictive model will be the creation of a virtual analyst that is able to recommend actions based on the enriched analysis of hundreds or thousands of simulations.\n\nThis project aims not only to improve the training methodologies and performance measurement of the analysts, but to create a new profile for new generation analysts that will get trained in a first stage and will operate the system later along their whole operational life, helping to enrich the system with new simulations and validation cases. These new analysts will be able to project new operational plans in advance by simulating “what-if” cases in complex scenarios, and anticipating threats.\n\nThe Consortium is an outstanding example of multi-sector collaboration between research excellence institutions, large corporation, end user and SMEs from five European Countries.

One relates to road-side unit communication while the other involves the interaction with cloud application and passengers' smart devices. Then, adopting a systematic vertical approach SAFERtec will obtain an in-depth look of the possible vulnerabilities performing penetration-testing on individual hardware components and upper-layer V2I applications. Considering the available security mechanisms a third party provider already applies to each module, SAFERtec will determine a corresponding protection profile as a summary of the identified risks. An innovative framework appropriately designed for unified and thus, cost-effective use across all modules will employ statistical tools and security metrics to quantify the involved security assurance levels and also feed the incomplete automotive standards.

SAFETY4RAILS concentrates on rush hour rail transport scenarios where many passengers are using metros and railways to commute to work or attend mass events (e.g. large multi-venue sporting events such as the Olympics). When an incident occurs during heavy usage, metro and railway operators have to consider many aspects to ensure passenger safety and security, e.g. carry out a threat analysis, maintain situation awareness, establish crisis communication and response, and they have to ensure that mitigation steps are taken and communicated to travellers and other users. SAFETY4RAILS will improve the handling of such events through a holistic approach.  It will analyse the cyber-physical resilience of metro and railway systems and deliver mitigation strategies for an efficient response, and, in order to remain secure given ever-changing novel emerging risks, it will facilitate continuous adaptation of the SAFETY4RAILS solution; this is validated by two rail transport operators and the results supporting the re-design of the final prototype.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883532","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"229144","payments":"30","beneficiaries":"30","total_amount":"7697691.39","startDate":"2020-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2022-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Analysis of the ecosystems of cybercriminal activity, associated markets and revenues will drive the development of a framework of business models appropriate for the fighting of cybercrime.  The role of regulatory approaches as a cost benefit in cybercrime reduction will be explored within a concept of greater collaboration in order to gain optimal attrition of cybercriminal activities. Experimental economics will aid SAINT in designing new methodologies for the development of an ongoing and searchable public database of cybersecurity indicators and open source intelligence. Comparative analysis of cybercrime victims and stakeholders within a framework of qualitative social science methodologies will deliver valuable evidences and advance knowledge on privacy issues and Deep Web practices. Equally, comparative analysis of the failures of current cybersecurity solutions, products and models will underpin a model for greater effectiveness of applications and improved cost-benefits within the information security industry. SAINT proposes to advance measurement approaches and methodologies of the metrics of cybercrime through the construct of a framework of a new empirical science that challenges traditional approaches and fuses evidence-based practices with more established disciplines for a lasting legacy. SAINT’s innovative models, algorithms and automated framework for objective metrics will benefit decision-makers, regulators, law enforcement in the EU, at national and organisational levels providing improved cost-benefit analysis and supported by tangible and intangible costs for optimal risk and investment incentives. The resulting ongoing business spin off and the potential for novel research and further studies will be attractive to academia and researchers beyond the lifetime of the project.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/economics and business/economics;/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/business model;/social sciences;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security;/social sciences/economics and business;/natural sciences/biological sciences/ecology/ecosystems;/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/740829","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"210229","payments":"9","beneficiaries":"9","total_amount":"1998700.0","startDate":"2017-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

{"id":"546","name":"SALIANT - Selective Antibodies Limited Immuno Assay Novel Technology","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"SALIANT aims to develop a hand-held device for real-time analysis of trace levels of explosives, chemicals and drugs. The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety. Thus the more analyte present, the more binding of secondary antibody occurs and the more signal is produced.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242377","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"95761","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"3362598.6","startDate":"2010-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

It’s not surprising, that digital data is nowadays - intentionally or not - involved in most criminal activities and is of upmost importance in the investigation process. Moreover, with cyber-crimes, a whole new area of criminal offences is emerging.\nTo face this fast-growing threat, and close the “digital gap” in investigations, law enforcement agencies established digital forensics units to find, extract and analyse digital data for fighting crimes, terrorism, espionage and improve cyber defence. Here, forensics experts are also confronted with damaged disks, deleted or compromised data. Most of them are not even looked upon, because forensic units are understaffed, lack data recovery specialists and don’t have the necessary hard- and software infrastructure, to legally suitable extract the evidence inhouse. This could mean the failure of the investigation or a crucial time delay!\nmh SERVICE, a leading specialist for digital forensics, developed the fastest, most efficient and powerful data recovery device that ever existed: SALUS. The portable system is designed for usage at any forensics lab and in the field by trained forensics experts. The system covers nearly all types of media interfaces, data storage technologies and recovery techniques. The fool-proof software guidance and performant hardware allows to significantly enhance efficiency and capabilities of forensic units.\nIn the feasibility study, a detailed analysis of the best-fitting market segments within the IT forensics market will be conducted, including the involvement of pilot customers for the validation of the business idea, as well as the elaboration of a thorough business plan for commercialisation. The findings of the feasibility study will be integrated into the subsequent SME Phase 2 project to perfectly facilitate the market introduction of SALUS.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/808099","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"215882","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2018-04-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

These networks are highly resilient and properly dimensioned to cope with crisis and emergency handling, and are well protected against monitoring and intrusion by means of encryption, authentication and integrity. The two main standards for digital PMR networks in Europe are TETRA (TErrestrial Trunked RAdio) and TETRAPOL.The majority of these networks are based on mature technology, requiring old-fashion synchronous links (backbone), and using proprietary hardware solutions that eventually become obsolete. These networks also provide limited inter-technology coverage providing very ineffective management  of emergency events, both at the national level and in cross-border regions.\nThe main goal of SALUS is to design, implement and evaluate a next generation communication network for Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) agencies, supported by network operators and industry, which will provide security, privacy, seamless mobility, QoS and reliability support for mission-critical PMR voice and broadband data services. The project covers the full techno-economic scope regarding development and deployment of the next generation PPDR networks by focusing on the integration with / migration to 4G wireless communications developments targeting three critical  scenarios 1) city security, 2) disaster recovery, and 3) temporary protection.

SAMURAI has three significant novelties that make it distinctive from other recent and ongoing relevant activities both in the EU and elsewhere: *SAMURAI is to employ networked heterogeneous sensors rather than CCTV cameras alone so that multiple complementary sources of information can be fused to create a visualisation of a more complete ‘big picture’ of a crowded public space. *Existing systems focus on analysing recorded video using pre-defined hard rules, suffering from unacceptable false alarms. SAMURAI is to develop a real-time adaptive behaviour profiling and abnormality detection system for alarm event alert and prediction with much reduced false alarm.   *In addition to fix-positioned CCTV cameras, the SAMURAI system will also take command input from control room operators and mobile sensory input for patrolling security staff for a hybrid context-aware based abnormal behaviour recognition. This is in contrary to current video behaviour recognition system that relies purely on information extracted from the video data, often too ambiguous to be effective. SAMURAI has the following scientific objectives: 1. Develop innovative tools and systems for people, vehicle and luggage detection, tracking, type categorisation across a network of cameras under real world conditions. 2. Develop an abnormal behaviour detection system based on a heterogeneous sensor network consisting of both fix-positioned CCTV cameras and mobile wearable cameras with audio and positioning sensors. These networked heterogeneous sensors will function cooperatively to provide enhanced situation awarenes. 3. Develop innovative tools using multi-modal data fusion and visualisation of heterogeneous sensor input to enable more effective control room operator queries.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/217899","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"89343","payments":"8","beneficiaries":"8","total_amount":"2478051.5","startDate":"2008-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2011-11-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

One of the key requirements to manage crisis is to have access to situational awareness (SA). However, current SA solutions (SAS) are not adapted to operate in cross-border contexts and present several shortcomings related to interoperability, data management/processing, decision making, standardisation and procurement. This hinders a reliable sharing of SA information. SAYSO will address these shortcomings and pave the way for the development of innovative European cost-effective Multi-Stakeholders SA Systems (MSSAS) which will provide practitioners with user-friendly solutions, providing a clear picture of the situation at hand with relevant advices. Addressing both the technical and human aspects of technology implementation, SAYSO will define the specifications of future MSSAS on the basis of practitioners’ requirements and specify the corresponding Reference Architecture to support the integration of various data into a common operational picture. This architecture will support interoperability and allow the integration of legacy and future SAS. It will also be customisable to practitioners’ needs and safeguard adequate privacy protection and data security levels. SAYSO will pursue the agreement and sustainable involvement of a community of practitioners, relevant suppliers and potential procurers, institutions and policy makers to obtain widely accepted results and prepare future procurement actions at EU level.

Being one of the major trends in the IT industry recently, it has gained tremendous momentum and started to revolutionize the way enterprises create and deliver IT solutions. As more sectors adopt cloud services in their computing environment, the trend will also reach ICT services operating critical infrastructures (CI), such as transportation systems or infrastructure surveillance.\nHosting CI services in the cloud brings with it security and resilience requirements that existing cloud offerings are not well placed to address.  Due to the opacity and elasticity of cloud environ-ments, the risks of deploying CI services in the cloud are difficult to assess – specifically on the technical level, but also from legal or business perspectives. Traditional IT security measures cannot fully tackle the issues (e.g. risk, trust, and resilience) arising from this paradigm shift, especially for operators and manufacturers of CI IT systems. Therefore, the mission of the SECCRIT project is to analyse and evaluate cloud computing technologies with respect to security risks in sensitive environments, and to develop methodologies, technologies, and best practices for creating a secure, trustworthy, and high assurance cloud computing environment for CI.\nIn order to accomplish this mission, the objectives of the SECCRIT project are: identification of the relevant legal framework and establishment of respective guidelines, provision of evidence and data protection for cloud services; understanding and managing risk associated with cloud environments; understanding cloud behaviour in the face of challenges; establishment of best practice for secure cloud service implementations; and the demonstration of SECCRIT research and development results in real-world application scenarios.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312758","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"106660","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"3397319.0","startDate":"2013-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Such a network appears very vulnerable and easy to contaminate through reservoirs, back-flow… The main objective of this proposal is to limit the impact on the population of safe water privation because of contaminated networks, and to launch an appropriate response for rapidly restoring the use of the network after a deliberate contamination. Questions that will be addressed for successful coordinated response of water utilities and regulatory agencies to contamination include: •Detection of unexpected changes in water quality which could be in relation with a deliberate contamination event, •Adaptation of known analytical methods to rapidly detect specific CBRN contaminants in water and in biofilms. •Localization of the point sources of contamination and subsequently the contaminated area allowing delimitation of the corrective actions. •Decontamination procedures (efficient and realistic) of the distribution system. •Controlling the efficacy of the corrective actions by analysing the water bulk and especially the pipe walls and the deposits. •Cases studies will give the chance for the practitioners to apply on site in real conditions the selected sensors, methods, remediation technologies… It is a unique occasion to test an emergency procedure on a complicated, inaccessible, and relatively fragile system, to evaluate its feasibility at field scale, and to evaluate the difficulty to apply corrective treatments to the huge water bulk generated by the neutralisation/extraction of contaminants.

This achievement is a great challenge, realizing diversity of technologies applied for security and the tremendous resources to provide it all over Europe. The Security sector is widely recognised as a key asset for the future of Europe and World. Security is a concern for everyone. New ideas and developments are needed to improve the research capabilities of the actors involved and to improve the security of European citizens in general. However, Security is also by common standards a very unusual business requiring specific rules, namely: it works on very long lead times, requires huge capital sums for developing its products and research and also requires a strong relation between all the organisations involved in the area. Europe needs to invest in Security targeting at the Industrial and research communities in order to address today’s and future challenges in this specific Sector, especially with respect to society and its political, demographic, social and economical evolutions. Therefore, it’s essential to build and maintain a highly competitive environment and this is only possible if the full integration of business processes across enterprises (involving key suppliers, usually SME) throughout the entire supply chain is achieved. In order to accomplish this to the maximum extent, the SecureCHAINS project will take the necessary steps to review the present status, scrutinize available resources and initiate a dialogue with the stakeholders and integrators of the security “big projects”.

Such attacks might be jointly imparted so as to affect large portions of the European grid, make repair difficult and cause huge societal impact. The outstanding importance and the far more complex level of interconnectivity of electricity distribution / transmission / generation – compared to the supply through other energy carriers - makes the development of a highly focused toolkit for its protection an essential and urgent task. SESAME develops a Decision Support System (DSS) for the protection of the European power system and applies it to two regional electricity grids, Austria and Romania. This DSS enables to:\n• identify the vulnerabilities and to detect their origins,\n• estimate the damage / impact of real or simulated network failures,\n• identify the possible measures for prevention of outages and acceleration of automatic restoration,\n• rank these measures according to their effectiveness and their cost-benefit ratios,\n• carry out contingency analyses of the transmission / distribution network and generation facilities,\n• detect long-term erroneous trends in the security of energy supply and counteract against them by adjusting the market mechanisms.\nThere do not exist State-of-the-Art approaches incorporating all of these core dimensions of the problem: the increase in complexity of the security of energy supply requires a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary solution. SESAME brings together the most distinguished experts in the fields of power network security, technology policy and regulatory economics, impact assessment of disasters, network simulation software and knowledge engineering. All partners have proven their excellence in complex security research in earlier cooperative projects and most of them have already worked together successfully.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/network security;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/application software/simulation software;/social sciences/economics and business/economics;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261696","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"98988","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"2753789.76","startDate":"2011-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

When a bridge collapse, the modular bridges available on the market are one of the conventional solutions that allow to restore the damaged infrastructures. In addition to the tragic human losses that these events often cause, there is always a high social and economic impact/cost due to the time between collapse and the bridge complete installation, that can reach several weeks or even months. BERD developed a new superfast launching system capable of launching an innovative modular bridge solution or even current modular bridges, based in a telescopic boom that can reduce the assembling and launching time up to 70%. Economic analysis shows that higher the importance of the road artery, higher is the payback of using the new Super Fast Telescopic Launching System (SF-TLS).

This Integrated Project will combine chemical and physical sensors integration with the development of an open ICT platform for addressing mobility and time-critical requirements of USaR Operations. The project will also focus on medical issues and on the relevant ethical dilemmas. SGL for USaR has marshaled a pan-European interdisciplinary project team to produce a well-balanced consortium of 21 partners including rescue teams, researchers and SMEs along with the support of 15 LOIs. The project is formed by eight sub-projects (work packages) running in parallel. These WPs address the development of simulation environments; the development and validation of portable devices for location operations; the development and validation of smart sensors environment for monitoring the situation under the ruins; the management of medical information, including privacy and bioethics; and finally the development of an ICT platform that will integrate all the previous data, ensure interoperability and control the flow of the information from the field to the operational center. SGL for USaR will deliver methods and guidelines, as well as, tangible prototypes: a stand-alone FIRST responder device that integrates five different location methods (five in one); a networked rapid casualty location system (REDS) equipped with wireless sensor probes; an advanced environmental simulator for training and testing search and rescue units, including canine teams; and a prototype mobile operational command and control platform.

Establishing efficient and effective ways to protect services and infrastructures from ever-evolving cyber threats is crucial for sustaining business integrity and reputation as well as protecting personal and sensitive data.\nTo that end, the SHIELD project proposes a universal solution for dynamically establishing and deploying virtual security infrastructures into ISP and corporate networks. SHIELD builds on the huge momentum of Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), as currently standardised by ETSI, in order to virtualise security appliances into virtual Network Security Functions (vNSFs), to be instantiated within the network infrastructure using NFV technologies and concepts, effectively monitoring and filtering network traffic in a distributed manner. Logs and metrics from vNSFs are aggregated into an information-driven Data Analysis and Remediation Engine (DARE), which leverages state-of-the-art big data storage and analytics in order to predict specific vulnerabilities and attacks by analysing the network and understanding the adversary possibilities, behaviour and intent. \nThe SHIELD virtual security infrastructure can either used by the ISP internally for network monitoring and protection, but it can also be offered as-a-service to ISP customers; for this purpose, SHIELD establishes a “vNSF Store”, i.e. a repository of available virtual security functions (firewalls, DPIs, content filters etc.) from which the ISP customers can select the ones which best match their needs and deploy them to protect their infrastructure. This approach promotes openness and interoperability of security functions and offers an affordable, zero-CAPEX security solution for citizens and SMEs. Moreover, SHIELD services can be easily scaled up or down, configured and upgraded according to customers’ needs, as opposed to security solutions based on monolithic hardware.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/network security;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/big data;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/data analysis","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700199","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202684","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"3607245.0","startDate":"2016-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-02-28 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

A major challenge for these first responding officers is to properly evaluate the situation and decide how to further proceed and to assess and choose the most appropriate strategy. The appropriateness of this decision is highly critical as it has a strong impact on the potential success of the operation as well as on the potential impacts, scene environment (e.g. witnesses, involved civilians, etc.) and consequences.\nSo the SHOTPROS project aims to investigate the influence of psychological and contextual human factors (HFs) on the behaviour of decision-making and acting (DMA) of police officers under stress and in high-risk operational situations in order to design better training for police officers to improve DMA Performance. SHOTPROS will develop a Virtual Reality (VR) solution to experimentally assess the degree to which these factors influence DMA behaviour. Subsequently the project will develop a HF-rooted training curriculum and a corresponding VR training solution to provide a comprehensive framework for practical training for decision-making and acting under stress and in high-risk (DMA-SR) situations in order to improve performance.The training will increase DMA-SR performance which will lead to better and more correct decisions (from several perspectives, e.g. law, ethic, etc.), to keep the guidance in threatened situations, to minimise use of force occurrences, and accordingly, to maximise the avoidance of casualties and collateral damage, such as panic and cascading or escalating effects.\nSHOTPROS involves 6 law enforcement agencies (LEA) as it sees the capabilities of effective, efficient and “correct” DMA-SR of police forces as an utmost important part of a European Security Model and a high need for the daily combat against crime, terrorism, CBRNe threats and radicalisms.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies;/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833672","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"222626","payments":"13","beneficiaries":"13","total_amount":"5059843.75","startDate":"2019-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2022-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Creating a unified transfer traces automated analysis toolkit would allow for a higher productivity of forensic workers, better crime resolution and enable further collaboration across end-users. \nIn addition to the lack of maturity of its potential components, the economical question is the barrier that hinders the development of such a toolkit as a sole forensic service can’t afford funding the corresponding R&D activities. the SHUTTLE project then intends to run a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) action between forensic institutes across Europe to mitigate these technical and financial barriers and jointly carry out the procurement of the necessary Research and Development (R&D) activities to develop a machine\\toolkit that will integrate different tape analysis tools to automate the routine part of the work of trace evidence examiners and, eventually, strengthen further judicial and police cooperation.\nThe SHUTTLE toolkit will be scientific, as the results obtained will be objective and validated, which will strengthen their usefulness and usability. It will be high-throughput, as the instrumentation will be built to process large amounts of samples and data. The acquired data will be stored in a database together with the results of other methods. These databases can be shared  and maintained together, and be used to provide a scientifically justified, numerical evidential value.\nFinally, SHUTTLE, which will be validated in conformity with ISO17025, will unify the methodology used in several European countries and will foster collaboration across countries and institutions in Europe.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/databases;/social sciences/economics and business/economics/production economics/productivity","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786913","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"216157","payments":"8","beneficiaries":"8","total_amount":"9511053.77","startDate":"2018-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2022-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

First responder deployments in extreme conditions such as fighting wildfires or alpine search and rescue missions have gone from exceptional to regular events in only a couple of decades. As this trend is likely to continue, the risks for wellbeing of the engaged first responders continue to grow. To avoid the loss of life or lasting consequences on the first responders’ health, it is important that the key physiological parameters of deployed operatives are monitored in a way that provides timely and actionable information, without hindering their operational capacity. \nThe SIXTHSENSE is a wearable health monitoring system with closed loop tactile biofeedback, that allows first responders in hazardous situations to sense their current health status.

{"id":"601","name":"SMART - Scalable Measures for Automated Recognition Technologies","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"Automated recognition of individuals and/or pre-determined traits or risk factors/criteria lies at the basis, indeed is the very raison d’être, of smart surveillance systems. Yet new EU regulations and specifically those on information sharing between police and security forces explicitly prohibit automated decision-taking regarding individuals unless “authorised by a law which also lays down measures to safeguard the data subject’s legitimate interests” (art 7, CFD 2008/977/JHA). Where are these laws, what can these measures be and what else should the laws contain? Can the laws be technology-neutral but sector specific, thus permitting a measured approach to the appropriateness of smart surveillance technologies in key security applications? Can they be extended to all security applications of smart surveillance, even those not covered by CFD 2008/977/JHA or the proposed directive set to replace it? This project (SMART) addresses these and other questions through a comprehensive approach which combines a technical review of key application areas by sector with a review of existing pertinent legislation to  then produce a set of guidelines and a model law compliant with CFD 2008/977/JHA and EU Directive 46/95 and the proposed successor legislation. The project first focuses on one meaning of “measures” i.e. it uses expertise from police and security forces from inside and outside the EU to “measure” (as in “calculate”) risk factors in a number of priority application areas for smart surveillance technologies including border control, crowd-control, counter-terrorism and e-government. Bringing together some of Europe’s leading experts on data protection with senior police officers responsible for using surveillance in the most CCTV-intensive cities in the world, SMART evaluates the appropriateness and available safeguards for on-line surveillance and associated risks inherent in data-sharing and exchange. Having thus identified appropriate instances of application as well as a number of technical, procedural and legal options for safeguards, the project moves on to create a tool-kit which would be useful to system designers, policy makers and legislative draughtsmen across Europe (and hopefully beyond). At this stage the project turns to a second meaning of “measures” i.e. it would bring to bear significant EU-wide expertise in data protection legislation in order to prepare a draft model law which would contain a number of measures providing adequate safeguards for the data subject and thus rendering use of smart surveillance compliant with CFD 2008/977/JHA and its proposed successor and other applicable regulations.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261727","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"99234","payments":"21","beneficiaries":"21","total_amount":"3456017.35","startDate":"2011-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-05-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

This is aggravated by illegal immigration, criminal striping, degradation of zones. The increase of criminal activity is manifested in an increased frequency of small crimes like graffiti, theft, robbery, destruction of rubbish bins. This has had a big impact for local governments, citizens and businesses.\nLocal government agencies are trying to solve these problems. As was shown in New York, a reduction in petty crimes increases the sense of public order which produces further reduction in crime in general. These organizations often treat the problem with classical solutions such as increase in police resources, reintegration of offenders, rehabilitation of degraded areas and modern solutions such as urban video surveillance. However, these new technologies are often underused and inadequate.\nThe SmartPrevent project aims to enhance detection and prevention of crimes in local urban areas by exploiting the full potential of video-surveillance systems. We will develop and provide four important benefits: i) Systematic characterization of usual petty crimes in an area under automatic surveillance; ii) automatic detection of the most usual and frequent criminal activities; iii) a set of automated tools capable of alerting the appropriate responders; and iv) early prevention of crimes by prediction and early detection of crimes.\nRather than providing new methodologies or tools, SmartPrevent will focus on: a) improving already-existing methodologies by means of a set of guidelines for the use of video-surveillance systems; and b) providing a set of tools capable to improve of the existing crime detection systems. Our solution will be validated by deploying a realistic prototype scenario, which will actively involve the detection and prevention for crimes in an urban areas and management of these detections by final users.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/606952","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"185481","payments":"6","beneficiaries":"6","total_amount":"1499995.5","startDate":"2014-03-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2016-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

However, in spite of the improvements, modern body armours still have some of the same drawbacks as the old ones, as they are mostly heavy, bulky and rigid. Therefore they limit the wearer’s mobility and agility and are impractical for use on joints, arms, legs, etc. Moreover, body armours have traditionally been designed to protect the wearer against ballistic threats and, thus, they provide only a limited level of protection against knives, sharp blades or sharp-tipped weapons. Recent studies, however, reveal that stab and puncture have become a main cause of police officers' injuries. Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop materials that combine stab and ballistic protection, while retaining their flexibility and low weight.\nIn this context, the proposed project aims to develop optimized ballistic textiles (both woven and spacer knitted fabrics) and apply innovative surface treatments (e.g. shear thickening fluids, ceramic coatings) to improve their performance on an areal density basis. Thus, fewer fabric layers will be required, which is expected to result in increased flexibility and reduced weight of the armour. Main parameters to consider also include physiological comfort and ergonomic design.\nAdditionally, smart functions, including positioning systems, will be integrated to further increase the efficiency of the body armour, eventually leading to reduced casualties.\nFinally, while a main limitation is that existing protective gear is usually limited to the body armour, innovative solutions are herein proposed for the protection of vulnerable body parts other than the torso.'","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/engineering and technology/materials engineering/coating and films;/engineering and technology/materials engineering/textiles;/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607295","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"185484","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"2781067.02","startDate":"2014-04-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

These micro enterprises (MEnts) are responsible for 30% and 21% of the overall employment and value added in the EU, respectively. However, when it refers to the imminent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)’s application, MEnts are the most vulnerable due to their lack of expertise and resources to invest in their adoption. It is urgent to develop solutions that assist MEnts in smoothly adopting the GDPR, safeguarding the interests of the EU citizens on data privacy and security, avoiding the negative socioeconomic consequences entailed to breaches for MEnts, and, by extension, benefitting the European society. SMOOTH project addresses this challenge from two complementary focuses:\n1) Creating awareness on the importance of being compliant with the GDPR, as many MEnts ignore their obligations in this respect, involving as partners Data Protection Authorities and associations representing EU MEnts. For the same purpose, SMOOTH will deliver a practical GDPR interactive handbook (website and mobile app) tailored specifically to MEnts. \n2) Assisting MEnts to effectively adopt and comply with the GDPR. The SMOOTH cloud platform will use machine learning, text and data mining, and advance online auditing methods to automatically create a bespoke GDPR compliance report for the most critical aspects to MEnts. Likewise, SMOOTH will provide useful materials for solving those identified aspects of the GDPR that are not properly covered.  \nAll this will positively contribute to citizens rights, while avoiding potential fines for the MEnts that may account for as much as 4% of the annual income, according to the GDPR. SMOOTH is born from technology partners and data protection authorities and will be designed and validated by actual MEnts with the aim of becoming the reference tool platform for them to adopt the GDPR.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/artificial intelligence/machine learning;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/data mining","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786741","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"214847","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"2986061.25","startDate":"2018-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2021-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

It will detect a range of substances, including but not limited to people, drugs, explosives (including weapons) and CBRNe. The technology will complement trained sniffer dogs.  The technology proposed is based on linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry (MS). MS techniques have been increasingly deployed in security sniffing applications in the USA. MS is a non-intrusive high-resolution technique able to detect single atoms and complex molecules through their charged species (ions) or fragmentation pattern. The technique is capable of detecting a wide range of substances rapidly, with high accuracy and with a stand-off capability – critically it is able to detect trace levels below parts per million. Once the MS fingerprint of a unknown substance is measured it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. Sniffles will develop a LIT MS based device with a larger mass range than other comparable MS techniques. Methods for miniaturisation and modularisation will be applied to allow reduced vacuum demand and upgradeability. Miniaturisation will be made possible through improved designs based on results from modelling, novel manufacturing techniques and improvements in the MS drive electronics and vacuum system. These advances will bring benefits including reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility. Sniffles has the potential to significantly impact on National Security and border control and enable exploitation of International Markets. Performance will be benchmarked against a state-of-the-art conventional MS system and security sniffer dogs – within the context of a border security checkpoint.

As our society is becoming increasingly dependent on Critical INfrastructures (CIN), new technologies are needed to increase our detection and response capabilities. Detecting and responding to such attacks by a highly motivated, skilled and well-funded attacker has however been proven highly challenging. One of the most vulnerable and high-impact CIN is the Smart Grid. Smart Grid is considered as the next-generation power system, which promises self-healing, resilience, sustainability and efficiency to the energy Critical Infrastructures (CIN). However, securing smart grids against cyber-attacks is of vital importance for National Security and Public Safety, since the collapse of an energy production utility may cause human lives, millions of euros, denial of a very important and common good such as energy and days or even months of recovering. To this end, the SPEAR proposal aims at a) detecting and responding to cyber-attacks using new technologies and capabilities, b) detecting threat and anomalies timely, c) developing all-in-one security detection solutions, d) leveraging advanced forensics subject to privacy-preserving, e) confronting Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and targeted attacks in smart grids, f) increasing the resilience of the smart grid innovation, g) alleviating the lack of trust in smart grid operators and h) empowering EU-wide consensus.

There is strong need to protect people, the societal community and critical infrastructures and utilities against being damaged, destroyed or disrupted by deliberate acts of terrorism. Solutions have to be derived to realize sufficient resilience of the urban infrastructure for rare occasions with minimum effect on normality. Hitherto, normal regulations and building guidelines do not take into account the CBRE threat. Fortunately, the required specialist knowledge is available on explosion dynamics, response of structures, dispersions of toxic agents and the injuries. This knowledge should be explored to derive the required solutions. Therefore, the SPIRIT Consortium was formed to bring the required expertise together, make these commonly available and to find solutions that can be integrated into normal life and planning and building procedures. Within SPIRIT a terrorist attack with the whole scope of CBRE-threat is addressed. The main outcome of the project is an integrated approach to counter CBRE-threats, including proposed guidelines for a EU Regulatory Framework. With this approach, government, end users of buildings and designers can define and achieve a desired level of protection. The SPIRIT contribution to built infrastructure protection will be: - A methodology to quantify the vulnerability of built infra in damage, number of injuries and loss of functionality and services; - A guidance tool to assess the vulnerability and define efficient and effective countermeasures to achieve a required protection level; - Draft guidelines to enable safety based engineering and the incorporation of CBRE protection; - A suite of ready to use CBRE countermeasure products.

The OECD and the EU’s Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) estimate that imports of counterfeit and pirated goods are worth nearly half a trillion dollars a year, or around 2.5% of global imports, with US, Italian and French brands the hardest hit. In the EU, the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) requires the introduction of a full tracking and tracing system by February 2019. Medicine packs will need to contain a unique identifier (2D barcode) and an anti-tampering device (such as labels), i.e. a technical means to ensure that the content of the package has not been tampered with. At present, there is no technology available on the global market which allows a true authentication of pharmaceutical products themselves, all initiatives so far concentrate on packaging only. SRAP technology overcomes this gap. SRAP is compatible with future FMD regulations; and can provide for fast, reliable and full tracking-and-tracing along the supply chain without the need to destroy product during authentication, while enabling true authentication on the product level - not just the package; and if necessary SRAP solutions provide for a database-independent authentication in the field (via mobile phone) – a very strong set of functionalities that combine to an extremely strong USP. The objectives of feasibility study are as follows – identify 3 potential commercial partners from pharmaceutical industry, define full-scale terms of reference jointly with the 3 partners identified and prepare a full business plan for a new joint venture entity.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/medical and health sciences/basic medicine/pharmacology and pharmacy/pharmaceutical drug;/social sciences/economics and business;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/information engineering/telecommunications/mobile phone","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/808887","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"217554","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2018-04-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-09-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The improvement of the response and management capabilities regarding assessment of incidences / failures in critical transport infrastructures will be achieved through the identification and closure of relevant knowledge gaps and through the development, validation and usage of computational modelling tools. STAR-TRANS aims at developing a modelling formalism in which specification of the structure and associated assets of European transportation networks as well as the specification of the dependency types between the assets of interconnected and interdependent transportation networks is facilitated. This modelling formalism will consider a transportation ‘network of networks’ as consisting of nodes and links. In so doing, tools from network and graph theory and the systems area will be employed. A specialised software system will be developed that will support the end users, and network operators needs. The software tool will provide the technology to link together any relevant assets of interconnected and interdependent transport networks, such that risk managers, policy makers and others can, subsequently, be provided with the impact that a risk incident on an asset of a specific transportation network may have on the assets of other interconnected and interdependent transport networks.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/system software;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/natural sciences/mathematics/pure mathematics/discrete mathematics/graph theory;/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/225594","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"92440","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"2105588.94","startDate":"2009-11-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2012-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

The security of critical infrastructures must be maintained so that supplies of power, water or other resources are secured.  Modern critical infrastructures are increasingly complex and they are turning into Cyber-Physical Infrastructures because ICT is growing in importance in infrastructure management.\nThe SUCCESS project will develop an overarching approach to threat and countermeasure analysis with special focus on the vulnerabilities introduced by Smart Meters. The main challenge is to create the conditions in Europe for the future energy system to be as reliable as todays.\nStarting from a security by design approach and placing resiliency and survivability in focus, a new joint design of Energy Infrastructure and ICT is proposed. Following on the research results, an implementation approach is pursued based on the definition of a New-generation Open Real-time smart Meter (NORM) as a key building block. NORM aims to secure the end nodes of the energy system while providing innovative services in a customer centric grid. At systems level, a cloud-approach, based on double virtualization, is proposed.\nSUCCESS will provide concrete guidelines to support the design of energy systems and linked communications networks to guide short, medium and long term initiatives. Countermeasures will include specifications and open source software for Next Generation Open Real time smart Meters and Security Monitoring Centres at DSO and Pan-European levels, secure communications solutions using NFV, LTE and 5G technologies complemented by data privacy studies to ensure the acceptability of the results by consumers. Trials will be run in Ireland, Italy and Romania. As a result, new business opportunities for energy providers, SME’s and start-ups will generate economic growth in the energy and ICT sectors.

Challenges arise due to the complexity of operational modalities of sea and hinterland traffic and the lack of efficient organisational and technological interfaces linking ports to border control authorities, the police and other intervention forces, and transport-logistics operators. Considerable progress with port security has been achieved in recent years primarily associated with adoption of the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code . SUPPORT is aimed at building on these achievements by engaging representative stakeholders to guide the development of next generation solutions for upgraded preventive and remedial security capabilities in European ports. The overall benefit will be the secure and efficient operation of European ports enabling uninterrupted flows of cargo and passengers while suppressing illegal immigration and trafficking of drugs, weapons and illicit substances all in line with the efforts of FRONTEX and EU member states. SUPPORT will deliver public formal specifications and open standards based tools that will aid security upgrade in EU ports and will be complementary to and usable by other EU projects and initiatives in this area. Emphasis will be given to bring together advances from research on security with results from the main EU projects in maritime and intermodal transport, specifically those concerned with security and interoperability issues. Thus, SUPPORT will address ‘total’ port security upgrade solutions encompassing legal, organisational, technology and human factors perspectives. These solutions should provide substantial improvements in the performance, reliability, speed and cost of European port security which will be demonstrated during the course of the project.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/social problems/migration;/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242112","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"94831","payments":"22","beneficiaries":"22","total_amount":"9920607.0","startDate":"2010-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

A total of 1170 home fires were reported in 2010 by the US National Fire Protection Association stemming from liquid petroleum gas (LPG) leakages, resulting in an annual average of 34 civilian fire deaths and 135 injuries. More than 7000 accidental fires and explosions occur annually due to LPG leaks in grills systems, resulting in more than 20,000 emergency room visits and more than 20 deaths, solely in US.\nThe Danish SME Integrated Gas Technology ApS (IGT) will target a major market opportunity through testing and demonstrating an innovative device to detect and shut-off gas leakages in LPG systems (Safe2LPG). The Safe2LPG solution has the potential to substitute current LPG gas regulators and become a step forward for safety and security standards of residential, commercial and public buildings supplied by LPG systems. The novel Safe2LPG is an advanced and highly sensitive mechanical shutoff gas valve, capable of detecting and automatically shutting off irregular gas consumption caused by gas leaks, including very small leaks (15 cm2/h). Safe2LPG will effectively mitigate the risk of long and dangerous gas leakages, and consequently their potentially serious consequences.\nBy ensuring and demonstrating a maximum level of safety and security, we will attain a key differentiating factor in order to gain access to the market. Initially, this will require a Phase 1 feasibility study that will give us a clear direction for our demonstration and market replication strategies. Subsequently, based on proven feasibility, in the Phase 2 we will need to generate full-scale showcases, which demonstrate the technical and economic benefits of our solution to generate enough consumer confidence and facilitate broader market uptake. Accordingly, we foresee a cumulative revenue of more than €101 million, 5 years after commercialization of the novel Safe2LPG.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/petroleum","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/744029","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"207643","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2017-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-03-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

These questions are currently not answered satisfactorily by existing technologies. Furthermore, recent developments in the wake of the expansive and sometimes unauthorized government access to private and sensitive data raise major privacy and security concerns about data located in the cloud, especially when data is physically located, processed, or must transit outside the legal jurisdiction of its rightful owner. This is exacerbated by providers of cloud services that frequently move and process data without notice in ways that are detrimental to the users and their privacy.\n\nSafeCloud will re-architect cloud infrastructures to ensure that data transmission, storage, and processing can be (1) partitioned in multiple administrative domains that are unlikely to collude, so that sensitive data can be protected by design; (2) entangled with inter-dependencies that make it impossible for any of the domains to tamper with its integrity. These two principles (partitioning and entanglement) are thus applied holistically across the entire data management stack, from communication to storage and processing.\n\nUsers will control the choice of non-colluding domains for partitioning and the tradeoffs between entanglement and performance, and thus will have full control over what happens to their data. This will make users less reluctant to manage their personal data online due to privacy concerns and will generate positive business cases for privacy-sensitive online applications such as the distributed cloud infrastructure and medical record storage platform that we address.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653884","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194907","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"2150810.0","startDate":"2015-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-08-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Our e-signature solution is:\n(a) very secure – we use a unique, proprietary, multi-authentication process, including biometric data, encrypting and sending material using a secure channel and logging every action,\n(b) easy to use from any device – the user can sign with a finger, mouse or stylus and send the signed material via regular email, with no special hardware or software installation and\n(c) provides significant value added through Smart contracts that take out the inefficient administrative processes around contract implementation.\nOur solution will finally allow companies to stop using a manual process, reducing paper use, improving companies’ competitiveness and boosting the economy. Signaturit is the first e-signature service that guarantees 100% legal validity in business digital transactions, minimises the risk of cybercrimes and drastically improves productivity.

Making the infrastructures “smarter” usually means making them smarter in normal operation and use: more adaptive, more intelligent… But will these smart critical infrastructures (SCIs) behave equally “smartly” and be “smartly resilient” also when exposed to extreme threats, such as extreme weather disasters or terrorist attacks? If making existing infrastructure “smarter” is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover?\nThese are the main questions tackled by this proposal.\nThe proposal envisages answering the above questions in several steps. (#1) By identifying existing indicators suitable for assessing resilience of SCIs. (#2) By identifying new “smart” resilience indicators (RIs) – including those from Big Data. (#3) By developing a new advanced resilience assessment methodology (TRL4) based on smart RIs (“resilience indicators cube”, including the resilience matrix). (#4) By developing the interactive “SCI Dashboard” tool. (#5) By applying the methodology/tools in 8 case studies, integrated under one virtual, smart-city-like, European case study. The SCIs considered (in 8 European countries!) deal with energy, transportation, health, water…\nResults #2, #3, #4 and #5 are a breakthrough innovation.\nThis approach will allow benchmarking the best-practice solutions and identifying the early warnings, improving resilience of SCIs against new threats and cascading and ripple effects.

In the past 10 years, 376,343 fatal road accidents were reported in the EU. These accidents cause even more injuries and cost at the global level 1-3% of the world’s GDP. Occupational accidents cause 350,000 deaths /year and millions of serious injuries worldwide. It is estimated that drivers’ fatigue and narcotics intake cause approx. 27% of fatal road accidents. This has dramatic effects on our economy, society, infrastructure and healthcare systems. Yet for time and cost reasons, road users and safety-critical professions are tested very rarely. Scientifics estimate a high “hidden” number of cases of fatigue and driving under the influence (DUI) of narcotics. This is due to the absence of reliable, all-in-one tests on the market. No fatigue detection system is currently used by traffic authorities. The pupillary light reflex - a recognised marker for fatigue and narcotics - is one of the most relevant indicators. Current detection systems are not economically viable or present technical drawbacks (analysis time, accuracy, invasiveness, heavy equipment). Company Stellar offers the first non-invasive, reliable and quickest fatigue and narcotics detection system using a unique process and algorithm for the biometric measurement of the human pupil light reflex.

{"id":"669","name":"SurPRISE - Surveillance, Privacy and Security: A large scale participatory assessment of criteria and factors determining acceptability and acceptance of security technologies in Europe","programme":"FP7-SECURITY","description":"SURPRISE re-examines the relationship between security and privacy, which is commonly positioned as a ‘trade-off’. Where security solutions involve the collection of information about citizens, questions arise as to whether their privacy has been infringed. This infringement of individual privacy is sometimes seen as an acceptable cost of enhanced security. Similarly, citizens are seen as willing to trade-off their privacy for enhanced personal security in different settings. These common understandings of the security-privacy relationship, both at state and citizen levels, have informed policymakers, legislative developments and best practice guidelines concerning security developments across the EU. However, an emergent body of work questions the validity of the security-privacy trade-off, suggesting that this has over-simplified the consideration of the impact and acceptability of security solutions on citizens in current security policy and practice. Thus, the more complex issues underlying privacy concerns and public scepticism towards surveillance-oriented security solutions (SOSSs) may not be apparent to legal and technological experts. In response to these developments, this project will consult with citizens from several EU member and associated states on the question of the security-privacy trade-off as they evaluate different security solutions. Through extensive preparatory work, the project will identify and empirically examine the influence of a broad range of issues upon their evaluations. Using citizen consultation meetings, questionnaires and innovative visual methods, a representative, fine-grained picture from across Europe will be provided. Further, citizens’ understanding of privacy protection laws, their enforcement, and the acceptance levels of SOSSs, will be explained. Finally, a set of context-dependent dimensions for decision support concerning the acceptability of new SOSSs which promotes civil rights protection will be produced.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285492","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102076","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"3424109.0","startDate":"2012-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-01-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

This infrastructure is complemented by human patrols, where there is an access to the border line. The system developed within the TALOS project will be more versatile, efficient, flexible and cost effective. The complete system applies both aerial and ground unmanned vehicles, supervised by command and control centre, but in the TALOS project the emphasis will be put on application of UGV, communication and ability to command and control. The ground platforms will be both the watching stations and the first reaction patrols, which will inform the Control and Command Centre and an intruder about her/his situation, and will undertake the proper measures to stop the illegal action almost autonomously with supervision of border guard officers. The most important features of the system are scalability, autonomous operation, mobility and adaptability. It will be easy to “scale’ the system to the local requirements such as border length and topographic conditions. The system elements would operate autonomously using the set of rules defined by Command and Control centre. The rules modified from time to time during system operation will adapt the system to the variable tactics of border crossing (in the specific patrol scenario, area of operation, border topography, etc.) and will constantly improve performance in the long term.

There are currently two types of technologies available for this application: those that automatically detect objects concealed on a person, and those that rely on human operator analysis and interpretation in order to classify or identify body-borne threats.\nThe objective of TeraSCREEN is to combine these two capabilities, thus providing automatic detection and classification of body-borne threats for security screening.  This will significantly improve both efficiency and security at border checks.\nTeraSCREEN aims to develop passive and active operation at several Terahertz frequencies.  The resulting multi-frequency, multi-mode images will be processed automatically in real-time to reveal the location of potentially harmful objects concealed on a person.  Privacy Enhancing Technologies will be used: the information will be displayed to the operator on a generic computerised silhouette and no anatomical details will be shown or saved.  Terahertz radiation is non-ionizing, and reliable studies have shown that active operation in this frequency band is harmless to humans.  The automatic recognition of threats, in addition to removing privacy issues, reduces the level of attention required from the operator, which implies a reduction in the personnel necessary for continuous operation.\nThe TeraSCREEN Prototype System will be demonstrated at a live control point in Bristol International Airport.

Despite the wide spectrum of such tools appears to provide a comprehensive machinery for detecting and responding effectively to cyber attacks, it is difficult to establish effective tool usage strategies and processes for addressing the ever-expanding land-scape of these attacks. Moreover, the advent of more “intelligent” cybersecurity solutions, which make use of technologies like machine learning, statistical analysis and user behaviour analysis, requires sophisticated and hands-on training of the key personnel of organizations, who have responsibility for security, for the latter to be able to master them. In response to the above, THREAT-ARREST will develop an advanced training platform incorporating emulation, simulation, serious gaming and visualization capabilities to adequately prepare stakeholders with different types of responsibility and levels of expertise in defending high-risk cyber systems and organizations to counter advanced, known and new cyber attacks. The THREAT-ARREST platform will deliver security training, based on a model driven approach where cyber threat and training preparation models, specifying the potential attacks, the security controls of cyber systems against them, and the tools that may be used to assess the effectiveness of these controls, will drive the training process, and align it with operational cyber system security assurance mechanisms to ensure the relevance of training. The platform will also support trainee performance evaluation and training program evaluation and adapt training programs based on them.

A single solution does not exist and many mine action actors have asked for a toolbox from which they could choose the tools best fit to a given situation. Some have built their own toolboxes, usually specific to some precise tasks, such as clearance.\n\nThe TIRAMISU project aims at providing the foundation for a global toolbox that will cover the main mine action activities, from the survey of large areas to the actual disposal of explosive hazards, including mine risk education. The toolbox produced by the project will provide mine action actors with a large set of tools, grouped into thematic modules, that will help them do their job. These tools will have been designed with the help of end-users and validated by them in mine affected countries.\n\nTo reach the level of expertise needed the TIRAMISU team includes organisations that were involved in some of the most important European and international research projects in mine action of the last fifteen years. The TIRAMISU partners will build on their past experience of this topic, their long tradition to work with each other, and the strong links they have forged over the years with mine action centres and mine action authorities, demining companies and non-governmental organisations, to bring a toolbox that will represent a step forward in mine action by being the basis for a unifying, comprehensive and modular integrated solution to the clearing of large areas from explosive hazards.\nThe philosophy of the TIRAMISU project is to concentrate most of its efforts, not on already existing technology, but on the most mature technologies and methods that are still to be fielded and on promising and innovating solutions even if they may require more work to be fielded","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/284747","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"102065","payments":"26","beneficiaries":"26","total_amount":"14934745.0","startDate":"2012-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

At best, there are automatic solutions to avoid abrupt incidents. Incipient as well as intermittent fault detection and isolation still occurs randomly. Also, more than 50% of Europe’s ageing infrastructure has been built before 1983, while gas consumption continues to grow. Regarding safety, although the standards and regulations enable to mostly avoid abrupt failures, the current maintenance requirements incur excessive costs for gas grid operators. E.g. in Germany, grid leakages are controlled by expensive airborne LIDAR monitoring systems. This is especially problematic in urban environments, in which most of the consumers are situated- without viable alternatives, grid operators must accept the cost.\n\nNevertheless, recent advancements in remote measurement technologies enable to develop substantially more effective grid monitoring solutions. For example, THE Systems and its team has already proven the viability of networked accelerometers for continuous grid monitoring tasks (THE Systems has tested the solution in an industrial environment in Finland).\n\nAs a result of this project, THE Systems will combine state of the art accelerometers with advanced signal processing based on computationally efficient algorithms. The uniqueness for urban settings stems from the nodes’ highly effective dampening features and the algorithm’s non-parametric, multivariate, and non-linear characteristics that operate despite high rates of random noise. Thus, it will be possible for grid operators to continuously detect and isolate faults in urban gas networks in an economically feasible manner. The broader impact will be an increase in urban gas grid safety, and at least a 50% reduction in respective grid maintenance costs. For THE Systems, TM Field Analyzer could generate up to 70 mEUR by year 5 after the product launch, and increase the number of staff by at least 70 employees.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/signal processing","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/651414","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194723","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2014-10-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-02-28 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

TWOBIAS will provide reliable information to command control systems (CCS) and first responders within seconds, enhancing security related to biological threats at high profile public sites. (figure 1.) The TWOBIAS system includes both detection (BDU – biological detection unit) and identification (BIU – biological identification unit) schemes: i) StageONE: First alarm based on best-in-use optimized optical BDU (detect-to-warn) ii) ii) StageTWO: Second alarm based on highly automated microfluidic-based platform with a molecular BIU (detect-to-treat) The development of reliable biological surveillance and detector systems depends on significant extensive critical testing and evaluation (T&amp;E) of the system, not only in controlled closed environments, but also at the real site of interest, prior to its operative use. Today, real-life testing is lacking. The approach of the project is unique in that the consortium will employ real-life test facilities to develop and prove a demonstrator of TWOBIAS for a successful approach to biological threats. Partner 6 (SCB) will provide a real-life test facility in central Europe that is regarded as a potential target for bioterrorism (i.e. Prague metro station). The project is distinctive because a detector and surveillance system for airborne biological threat agents will be developed according to the operational requirements by the end-user. TWOBIAS is not restricted for use against bioterrorist attacks, but is also suitable for detecting and identifying emerging natural infectious diseases (i.e. SARS, avian flu viruses and other airborne transmitted pathogenic microorganisms).","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/medical and health sciences/health sciences/infectious disease","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/242297","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"94832","payments":"12","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"3577834.0","startDate":"2010-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2013-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

It supports some of the most important Internet services such as search, social media and user generated content sites. However, the lack of transparency regarding tracking techniques and the type of information companies collect about users is creating increasing concerns in society. Software tools for implementing total mitigation (e.g., ad blocker or cookies blocker) have been released to block any transfer of information from end users towards the online advertising ecosystem. A massive adoption of these tools by end users may cause disruptions in the digital economy by affecting the online advertising sector and leading to consequences such as losing of a large number of employments.\nTYPES aims to cope with this challenge by defining, implementing, and validating in pre-market status a holistic framework of technologies and tools that guarantees both transparency and privacy preservation, gives the end user control upon the amount of information he/she is willing to share, and defines privacy-by-design solutions. In particular, these tools should enable the end user: i) to configure the privacy settings so that only the information allowed by the end-user is collected by online advertising platforms; ii) to understand the flow of their information within the online advertising ecosystem and how it is being used; iii) to detect episodes of information collection occurring without consent and identify the offender; iv) to know the value of their data. \nTYPES will demonstrate solutions that protect user’s privacy while empowering them to control how their data is used by service providers for advertising purposes. At the same time, TYPES will make it easier to verify whether users’ online rights are respected and if personal data is exchanged for a reasonable value-added to users.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/employment;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653449","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194867","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"3992663.0","startDate":"2015-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-10-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Especially from an industrial perspective, we entrust our most delicate details to these tools and, logically, we demand the highest level of integrity and availability to avoid any eventual data loss, unavailability or, maybe more important, misuse. However, cyberattacks in EU are costing businesses around €38 billion/ year.  How can we maximise our protection against these risks? Our company, Prosa Security, is developing V-SPHERE; a new solution for industrial cyber security that unveils and prevents vulnerabilities of any ICT system in a holistic way, i.e., covering all the development cycle and all company perspectives. Involving all the stakeholders in the security process, this unique approach has demonstrated to be 10 to 100 times more effective in detection than traditional methods, as well as to reduce by 3 the time allocated for quality and security assurance in SW development projects, resulting in saving from €45,000 to €300,000 per SW development project. The overall objectives of this project are: assessing the viability of V-SPHERE and building a solid business and operational plan (Phase 1); conducting the planned technical and commercial activities to prepare its commercialisation (Phase 2); and initiate the formal large scale commercialisation, seeking the promotion of V-SPHERE and the networking with financers (Phase 3). Our business opportunity is promising, with the European market of cybersecurity to reach €38.10 billion and the specific market of security testing solutions valued at €2.71 billion in 2022. The expected outcome of the project is estimated at €23.3 million by 2023, besides the creation of 27 job positions.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security;/social sciences/economics and business","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/791208","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"213311","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2018-02-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2018-05-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Conceptually, the Reasoning Workspace comprises three areas: (i) a Data Space which will enable an analyst to see what data and themes exist, (ii) an Analysis Space to which data can be brought into to carry out various computational analyses including statistical and text analysis, and (iii) a Hypothesis Space that will enable the analysts to assemble their evidence into coherent arguments that lead to meaningful and valid conclusions.\n\nThe user interface will be rooted in the concepts of Visual Analytics – the emerging “… science of analytical reasoning facilitated by visual interactive interfaces' (Thomas and Cook, 2004), and specially designed to support the interactive dynamics (Heer and Shneiderman, 2012) required to enable real-time analytic interaction with data. The design of the user interface will move away from the traditional windows and list of lists views for presenting data, and instead to create information objects that may be directly manipulated and freely organised visuo-spatially by the analysts so that location and spatial groupings have meaning and can be manipulated directly by selection and dragging; or we can initiate Boolean operations on the content of the two or more clusters by dragging one cluster onto another. In addition, the presentation of multiple views of the information objects, in the form of network graphs, timelines, geo-spatial etc. can lead to further insight, especially when interactivity is enabled.

Administrators and security experts face a variety of evolving threats that are hard to anticipate. To secure a government building against multiple threats while maintaining a minimal level of transparency and accessibility requires an integral security approach. It demands interdisciplinary collaboration between different experts from different domains. Currently, there is no efficient method or tool that allows the experts of different stripes to efficiently design, evaluate and implement appropriate security concepts. Existing ones do not allow for the effective creation, analysis, assessment, and sharing of security concepts that will help government administrators provide a secure environment for personnel and citizens.\n\nThe VASCO project addresses two important objectives. First, it will design, implement and evaluate an innovative IT tool that will enable security professionals and administrators to jointly formulate, test, and adjust security concepts and measures in a virtual environment. This provides a cost-effective and risk-free environment in which to devise an evidence-based, all-risk approach for the protection of government buildings. Second, it will produce a knowledge and best practice database, which captures dynamic and visual reference scenarios created with the VASCO system.\n\nTo accomplish these aims, the project will adopt an iterative methodology that enables the constant involvement of its world-class security and crisis management experts, assisted by a solid and open user group, during the whole project. It makes use of the latest advances in interactive visualisation, simulation, crisis management, and artificial intelligence to provide end-users with a new tool that significantly improves the way in which they collaborate to secure critical government assets both at home and abroad.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/artificial intelligence","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607737","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"185496","payments":"7","beneficiaries":"7","total_amount":"3037341.0","startDate":"2014-03-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-02-28 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Despite some promising approaches, still no proven method of leakages and exfiltration measurement on a wider scale is available so authorities and companies are not aware of its impact on groundwater pollution.\nIndirect measuring methods as groundwater sampling or modelling, are mostly too complicated for sewer operators to apply. Direct procedures yield exfiltration rates for single leaks, but the extrapolation to overall exfiltration rates is questionable due to the inhomogeneity of defects.\nOur technology is based on an ongoing monitoring plan to anticipate the consequences of leakages. With the ambition of reducing the amount of Contaminants of Emerging Concern that can cause harm to the environment and human populations, and based on practical experience acquired through the Western Galilee Incident where R.Z.E.E. professionals detected an alarmant percentage of leakages (20%), we developed and patented an unique technology, “Any Geometry Flume”, a system adapted to measure gravitational flows in a simple, precise and relatively inexpensive way.\nWith the development of VIGI-LEAK, we aim to complement our technology with a highly precise real-time flow measurement software. VIGI-LEAK is a correlation system located in the 'internet cloud' to monitor sewage systems and alert if there is a fault or malfunction in some segment, calculating the magnitude of the leakage. It will release sewer operators from being dependant on expensive flow data delivery services providers, representing a powerful tool for engineers and decision makers.

With half of the world’s population currently living in urban centres, and with this figure set to increase to two-thirds by 2050, the issue of security and citizen safety is of paramount importance and a growing concern. In view of the growing number of threats from global terrorism, natural disasters or crime, urban planning practice must incorporate appropriate security measures for vulnerability identification and resilience enhancements.\nUrban planning is a process involving numerous stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams. Although the use of software tools plays a significant role in this complex process, yet, none exist that take into consideration the security (and connected safety) aspects of urban planning as a whole.\nUrban planning teams need tools that fully encompass the pre-application process with developers/designers, and facilitate flexible solutions, not imposed measures. The objective of VITRUV is the development of software tools for the long and complex screening process, which is urban planning, moving across three levels from concept to plan to detail design. Based on an all hazard risk approach, the tools will enable planners\n• to make well-considered systematic qualitative decisions (concept level),\n• to analyse the susceptibility of urban spaces (e.g. building types, squares, public transport, and their functionalities) with respect to new threats (plan level), and\n• to perform vulnerability analyses of urban spaces by computing the likely damage on individuals, buildings, traffic infrastructure (detail level).\nAll levels (concept, plan and detail) will contribute to enabling the development of more robust and resilient space in the field of urban (re)planning/(re)design/(re)engineering. Planners who use VITRUV’s tools will be able to deliver urban space less prone to and less affected by attacks and disasters, thus sustainably improving the security of citizens","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261741","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"98970","payments":"13","beneficiaries":"12","total_amount":"3614298.0","startDate":"2011-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2014-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

This pushes for greater transparency, accountability and innovation aiming at increasing citizen levels of confidence and trust in PA online services. In this context, user data privacy is an important issue. VisiOn will deliver a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Visual Privacy Management Platform, which empowers any citizen to achieve desired levels of privacy by creating and monitoring a personal Privacy Level Agreement. The platform will provide clear visualisation of privacy preferences, relevant threats and trust issues along with an insight into the economic value of user data. The platform will equip PAs with the right tools to improve the transparency and accountability of their operations, by supporting visual analysis of (i) privacy issues at different levels (e.g. design, run-time) and perspectives (i.e. citizen, PA); (ii) regulation compliance; and (iii) business/operational processes. The VisiOn consortium will leverage existing software, tools and methodologies, which partners have developed in previous projects, towards the implementation of the privacy platform software components. The latter will be tested in an operational environment (i.e. TRL 7), in three different pilot scenarios across two different scenario types (i.e. citizen/PA & PA/cross-border PA). Pilots will involve users from three European countries. Driven by the lack of appropriate products in the market, as identified by the relevant market analysis, the VisiOn exploitation strategy is based on commercialisation of the project results at three levels: platform-as-a-whole, fragments of the platform, and partner individual exploitation. This strategy will enable partners to integrate the project results into their existing commercial offerings, thus exploring and establishing new business opportunities and ventures.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/system software;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/social sciences/political science/public administration","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653642","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194888","payments":"13","beneficiaries":"13","total_amount":"2748912.5","startDate":"2015-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-06-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

Current sensors used nowadays (Cameras, ultrasonic sensors, etc.) are devices that are normally visible to the individuals, and have limited capability of discrimination between objects and people. Also the continuous monitoring is performed normally by cameras that make the solution complex and expensive (large amount of data to store and to process).  WARDIAM PERIMETER sensors allow preventive detection, continuous monitoring and discrimination, and are easily camouflaged, and in the case of an event (preventive or effective intrusion), the cameras can start functioning to show the intruder to the security personnel. Apart from these innovative features, WARDIAM PERIMETER has superior advantages such as cost reductions, in the capex (systems, installations) and in the opex (maintenance). This proposal is key to ONTECH, as Industrial Protection has been identified by ONTECH as the Core Business for the Company, after successfully developed a product for the Home Security market.\nWARDIAM PERIMETER key technology (CMF sensors) has been demonstrated in a industrially relevant environment (Home security).

Currently, water utilities rely on manual sampling to monitor water quality; however it may take days before a contamination event is detected. Competition relies on expensive sensors; as a result, most water utilities can only install such specialized sensors at very few locations within a network, thus offering reduced coverage. \n\nSmartTap is a cyber-physical system comprised of low-cost wireless sensory devices (physical) and smart cloud software (cyber) that are seamlessly integrated, so that the software is able to analyze the data in real-time, as well as to compensate hardware inaccuracies. The SmartTap devices monitor several physicochemical water parameters with low-cost sensors and fuse multi-sensor data at a local level to infer possible contamination events. The goal is to provide real-time water quality monitoring information to consumers and utilities and to reliably detect any contamination events within 1-2 hours, instead of days, thus significantly reducing the financial and societal impact of that event. The SmartTap Sensor System already exists as a home/industry product of Aqualligence, and is currently being field-tested by a water utility. In addition, Aqualligence provides consulting services for water security. Aqualligence envisions to offer a contamination alert service for the protection of water utilities, a very niche market which is not affected by strong competition. \n\nThe feasibility study will present the analysis of the market segments/customer needs, the competition and the competitive advantages, the various business models and the best IP Management strategy, the risks and the financial projections under various scenarios.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce;/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/business model;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software;/social sciences/economics and business;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/672922","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"197951","payments":"1","beneficiaries":"1","total_amount":"50000.0","startDate":"2015-07-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

It intends to address some of the dilemmas and paradoxes of external interventions that aim for local ownership in third countries, by exploring principles, processes and tools that can enhance EU capabilities. This will be achieved through the project’s Review, Reflect, Recommend and Innovate objectives. ‘Review’ will assess past and ongoing conflict prevention and peacebuilding initiatives of the EU and its partners, focusing on three types of EU interventions: multi-track diplomacy, security sector reform, and governance reform. The assessment will be based on field research in Georgia, Mali, Ukraine and Yemen, and desk reviews looking beyond these countries. ‘Reflect’ will create a ‘community of practice’ providing forums for dialogue that will bring together policymakers, civilian and military practitioners, academic experts and beneficiaries of EU interventions. These will validate and apply the evidence base by focusing on cross-cutting themes: local ownership, gender, multi-stakeholder coherence, civil-military synergies and ICTs. ‘Recommend’ will elaborate the project findings into a tailored set of recommendations and enhance their impact through direct policy engagement and an international dissemination strategy. ‘Innovate’ will contribute significantly to civilian conflict prevention and peacebuilding by identifying research priorities and tools, and enhancing the potential of ICTs. The project Whole-of-Society Approach to Conflict Prevention and Peacebuilding is a conscious attempt to address the relationships of peacebuilding actors within a wider cultural and institutional context. It deals with issues of coordination, synergies and inclusivity of peacebuilding efforts, where diverse stakeholders have a role to play in the process.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653866","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194904","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"1990114.25","startDate":"2015-06-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2017-11-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Rise in government investments in the critical infrastructure sector, need for reduction in manpower cost, and increasing need for security against terrorist attacks are among the main factors responsible for the growth of the perimeter intrusion detection systems market across the globe.\nSystems such as fiber optic or microwave sensing technologies available in the market suffer from drawbacks associated with false alarms (40% false alarms on average) since they are unable to differentiate between humans, objects and animals. Moreover, existing products are not efficient in operation because both sensors and cameras need to be always operational to be prepared in case of intrusion (contributing to 60%-80% energy inefficiency).\nWARDIAM PERIMETER system is Ontech’s new product for industrial security specifically targeting critical infrastructures. It is able to do surveillance of large areas close to a building or walls. The sensors monitor the environment continuously and trigger an event when it detects a person in the surrounding (preventive alarm together with video capture) and followed by another trigger in the case there is an intrusion (intrusion alarm). Main advantages are: Preventive detection (threats are detected even before they have been carried out), discriminative (CMF technology is able to distinguish if intrusion is provoked by a human, an animal or an object), hidden system (technology can be installed inside the fence), differentiating between distinct alarm levels (grade of threat can be measured distinguishing between loitering, touching or climbing the fence), tracking and identification of the intruders (collaborative tracking of the intruders) and personal data protection law friendly (cameras can be turned off while there are no threats).

The main goal of beAWARE is to provide support in all the phases of an emergency incident. More specifically, we propose an integrated solution to support forecasting, early warnings, transmission and routing of the emergency data, aggregated analysis of multimodal data and management the coordination between the first responders and the authorities. Our intention is to rely on platforms, theories and methodologies that are already used for disaster forecasting and management and add the elements that are necessary to make them working efficiently and in harm under the same objective. The overall context for beAWARE lies in the domain of situational awareness and command and control (C2). The first phase concerns the forecast of the extreme condition and the relevant preparations. Once a disaster occurs, an initial assessment needs to be conducted as soon as possible to determine the scope, geographical distribution, and scale of the incident. Situational awareness means being able to accurately determine what has happened, what is happening now, and what will come next, all in order to plan and coordinate the most effective response possible with the resources available. This observation phase will lead to an orientation phase suggesting both an individual as well as collective “cognition” orientation to data that is sensed and communicated. Once orientation to the data (or the lack of it) occurs then a decision is made, ultimately resulting is the final step, which is “act”. The crisis management center is always striving or struggling to gain a sense of what is reality to be able to feel that he or she can make a decision that is the 'best possible' given the circumstances.'","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700475","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"207286","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"5953780.0","startDate":"2017-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

CPS are characterised by safety-critical nature, complexity, connectivity, and open technology. A common downside to CPS complexity and openness is a large attack surface and a high degree of dynamism that may lead to complex failures and irreparable physical damage. The legitimate fear of security or functional safety vulnerabilities in CPS results in arduous testing and certification processes. Once fielded, many CPS suffer from the motto: never change a running system.\ncertMILS increases the economic efficiency and European competitiveness of CPS development, while demonstrating the effectiveness of safety & security certification of composable systems.\nThe project employs a security-by-design concept originating from the avionics industry: Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS), which targets controlled information flow and resource usage amongst software applications. certMILS reduces certification complexity, promotes re-use, and enables secure updates to CPS throughout its life-cycle by providing certified separation of applications, i.e. if an application within a complex CPS fails or starts acting maliciously, other applications are unaffected.\nSecurity certification of complex systems to medium-high assurance levels is not solved today. The existing monolithic approaches cannot cope with the complexity of modern CPS. certMILS uses ISO/IEC 15408 and IEC 62443 to develop and applies a compositional security certification methodology to complex composable safety-critical systems operating in constantly evolving hostile environments. certMILS core results are standardised in a protection profile.certMILS develops three composable industrial CPS pilots (smart grid, railway, subway), certifies security of critical re-useable components, and ensures security certification for the pilots by certification labs in three EU countries with involvement of the authorities.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/731456","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"207195","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"3999055.63","startDate":"2017-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},

We seek to better European preparedness, resilience and incident response to CBRN attacks and emerging threats through close multi- (stakeholders) and single-discipline (practitioners) interactions. This makes CBRN TC the perfect operational intermediary between all civilian and military CBRN actors, EU relevant bodies and policy-makers, as well as the best cradle for expansion of a CBRN network of professionals. Main pillars for the network and confidence building will be to pool and share resources, effective practices and lessons learned, to map and label EU CBRN TC based on their capabilities and specificities, and to use a dedicated web based information and communication platform for exchanges and dissemination. Rather than usual workshops that are of no interest for task-focused, busy practitioners, the CBRN TC network will organize joint activities, training and debriefing in well-adapted infrastructures, using real-life or simulated situations (e.g., field exercises, table top, serious gaming and simulations), with external partners, in order to foster the identification of genuine users’ needs with users-driven technological solutions. This network will also benefit to national and EU CBRN projects, thereby expanding network scope and size, fast-tracking innovations and dissemination. Whilst using efficiently investments made across Europe in demonstration, testing, and training facilities for practitioners, this novel concept will issue meaningful users-guided recommendations to the EU R&D programme, enhance CBRN product performance and competitiveness, and decrease EU market fragmentation.

An important means for law enforcement in combatting such crime is strategic early warning which is heavily depending on an efficient and effective environmental scanning.\nFro this, the e-POOLICE project will—in close collaboration with law enforcement partners, as well as criminological and legal experts—develop a prototype of an environmental scanning system implementing solutions applying the most promising technological advances and breakthroughs as provided by the RTD partners. The solutions will be tested an evaluated through running realistic use case scenarios that are developed by our user partners.\nCentral to the solution is development of an environmental knowledge repository of all relevant information and knowledge, including scanned information and derived, learned or hypothesized knowledge, as well as the metadata needed for credibility and confidence assessment, traceability, and privacy protection management.  For effective and efficient utilization, as well as for interoperability, the repository will apply a standard representation form for all information and knowledge.\nFor effective and efficient scanning of the raw information sources, the project will develop an intelligent environmental radar that will utilize the knowledge repository for focusing the scanning. A key part of this process is semantic filtering for identification of data items that constitutes weak signals of emerging organized crime threats, exploiting fully the concept of crime hubs, crime indicators, and facilitating factors, as understood by our user partners.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet;/social sciences/law;/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/information engineering/telecommunications/radio technology/radar","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312651","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"106659","payments":"21","beneficiaries":"19","total_amount":"3808173.69","startDate":"2013-01-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2015-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

All underground infrastructure is only accessible through one method – inspection chambers. These inspection chambers are common and 100s can exist within a small area. To prevent criminal damage to infrastructure and ensure safety, all of these chambers are covered with access covers. There have been no major innovations of access covers in recent times and most remain completely unsecure and vulnerable. Requests to increase security has resulted in simple measures taken in the form of padlocks and key-locks, which still leave significant vulnerabilities. Alongside these vulnerabilities, covers in strategic sites need daily monitoring. This is currently done manually with physical inspections. There is a significant cost incurred for this.\n\nWe are Hugslock Systems and have developed a solution that will secure all underground infrastructure. We have created iNTelligent Access Cover Technology ‘iNTACT’ that will truly revolutionize the security of underground critical infrastructures. iNTACT is the world’s first remote lockable access cover. It is secure, impenetrable and intelligent. Intelligence is embedded within the cover in the form of sensors that can offer various monitoring capabilities such as gas, heat, water sensors, Infrared CCTV, motion, bio-hazard and seismic.\n\niNTACT completely removes the need for any physical inspections, as the remote-operated locks can be remotely monitored from a central control room. We have strong market-pull from utility providers such as SITEL of the Czech Republic and organizations such the Ministry of Defence.

However, diversity is united by the common aim, of providing timely care to victims of sudden and life-threatening injuries, emergencies or disasters within EU-member states (EUMS), in cross-border settings and international humanitarian missions. Fostering the response capacities and increasing the cooperation of the European Emergency Medical Services Systems (EMSS) is of decisive importance for strengthening the resilience of European societies in the light of multiple hazards: Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of disasters, terrorism is becoming a very real scenario for mass causality events challenging both out-of-hospital as well as in-hospital emergency care, and health related hazards are calling for close cooperation of public safety and health authorities on an international level. Not only hazards but also the system’s diversity poses a challenge for preparedness planning and cooperation, which needs to involve the whole EMS system at regional and/or national level and integrate it into the whole health system and fully coordinate with the public safety system to be effective. The iProcureSecurity project seeks to identify the major challenges the system’s diversity poses to the ability to work together, stimulate R&I uptake with a view to increasing standardisation of operations across Europe, and deliver technical requirements for R&I activities to create a European system of Medical Emergency Teams that is more homogeneous and capable to work as singly unit. To achieve this aim, the project will engage in several exchange cycles with practitioners and other stakeholders in the innovation landscape as a preparation for major R&I activities as part of a PCP action.","summary":"Role: coordinator\n---\nTopics:\n/medical and health sciences/clinical medicine/emergency medicine;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833291","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"222610","payments":"10","beneficiaries":"10","total_amount":"999975.0","startDate":"2019-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2020-12-31 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}

Their loss or damage causes significant financial losses to any company.\nFortunately the use of backup and file recovery systems is obvious for more and more responsibly thinking companies. Cutting-edge technologies are available for them to secure their data. However current options do not provide a holistic solution.\nWe, at iSave Ltd. created an innovative solution, which gives the security of a local backup, but with an ultrafast recovery speed and scalable system structure.

In 2000 41 significant attacks on aid workers were recorded across the globe. By 2014, that number had risen to 190. In this 15-year period, over 3,000 aid workers have been killed, injured or kidnapped. Despite the increasing availability of tracking and monitoring technologies, the number of humanitarian workers that fall victim to attacks continues to rise. Clearly, a novel and innovative approach to tracking and decision-making is needed.  \nInformation systems for fleet management, GPS for navigation and location or RFID tags for inventory management are just a few of the technologies that have changed the humanitarian operations. Until now, however, there is no integrated decision support system that provides real-time analyses from the data streams that are generated by these technologies.  This lack of integrated real-time information prevents an understanding of potentially threatening situations, increases response times and creates insecure communications, all leading to inadequate protection and hampered efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe aim of better protection and more efficient and effective operations can only be achieved by devel-oping technologies along with the policies for their use. GPS, for example, notwithstanding its capability to provide live tracking of vehicles for recovery, cannot prevent an ambush or kidnapping. Technologies therefore need to go hand in hand with procedures and policies in order to provide useful early warnings to decision-makers on the ground as well as decision support for scheduling, navigation, risk management and coordination. Policies, in other words, provide for the essential guidance on how to use the technologies in the field. This project will develop human-centred technologies that take into ac-count actual real-world practices of humanitarian aid workers, and provide policies for better protection and a more effective and efficient response.\nBased on principles of Privacy by Design, this project will build the iTRACK system, an integrated intelli-gent real-time tracking and threat identification system to improve protection of responders and assets, and provide information management and logistics services such as real-time information updates and analyses as well as navigation, routing and scheduling. iTRACK will achieve this through an interdiscipli-nary, socio-technical approach, which will draw on the latest advances in sensor development, GIS, secu-rity & privacy, artificial intelligence, information management, risk analysis, and humanitarian logistics.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/artificial intelligence;/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services;/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/physical geography/cartography/geographic information systems","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700510","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"202695","payments":"13","beneficiaries":"13","total_amount":"3714963.75","startDate":"2016-05-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-04-30 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""},
{"id":"748","name":"microMole - SEWAGE MONITORING SYSTEM FOR TRACKING SYNTHETIC DRUG LABORATORIES","programme":"H2020-3.7","description":"The threat of synthetic drugs is one of the most significant current drug problems worldwide. Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS) are the second most widely used drugs. Since 1990, ATS manufacturing has been reported from more than 70 countries worldwide and the figure keeps rising. In 2008, 80 % of the amphetamine production facilities dismantled worldwide were located in Europe (UNODC, 2010) (EMCCDA, 2011). Organised Crime Groups are involved in ATS large-scale production (Europol, 2007) (EMCDDA, 2009). Since 2011, the wide availability of pre-precursors (like APAAN) significantly lowered the price of the controlled precursor BMK and caused severe environmental problems, taking the problem to a greater dimension.\n\nThe aim of this project is to design, develop and test a prototype of a system for legal recording, retrieving and monitoring operations of ATS and ATS precursor laboratories in urban areas. The sensor system will be installed within the sewage system and will track waste associated to ATS production. Criminal investigators and forensic specialists will use the system in case of:\n1. initial general suspicion of ATS production in a certain area, for locating laboratories by monitoring the sewage system for long time periods;\n2. strong suspicions that in a well confined area ATS is being produced, for collecting material for forensic analysis and potential use in court, and for aiding in the planning of LEA raid operations. \n\n\nThe μMole prototype will contain the following features: a) miniaturized system for 200mm sewage pipes, b) robust housing taking into account sewage system environment, c) minimized power consumption, d) enhanced operation time supported by energy harvesting, e) high-specificity electro-chemical sensors, f) integrated micro-tanks for sample storage, and g) secure GSM and radio communications for remote monitoring. Analysis of privacy law, data protection and social acceptance will be carried on at different stages.","summary":"Role: participant\n---\nTopics:\n/social sciences/law;/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection","sourceUrl":"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653626","proof":"23790440.1fdf38cc18f1eea964c7325b210880b80e8eff6d","recordId":"194878","payments":"11","beneficiaries":"11","total_amount":"4992866.33","startDate":"2015-09-01 00:00:00.000000","endDate":"2019-02-28 00:00:00.000000","language":"","name_en":"","description_en":""}
