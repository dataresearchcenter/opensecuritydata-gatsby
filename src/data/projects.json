A user-driven approach will be taken to develop new technologies for supporting user information requirements at the scene of the event. First responders belong to a heterogeneous group in terms of crisis environments as well as roles, command structure, organisational and national differences. Therefore, the project will apply a wide range of human factors methods to better understand the processes of individual agencies to ensure that new systems both match requirements and can be integrated with legacy processes and technologies. COPE will use the skills and competencies of a strong team of research scientists both from industry and academia, of technology providers and systems integrators supported by end users. The project will develop use cases with end users to build a rich picture of the requirements and moreover the differences in requirements across agencies, organisations and nations. Supported by the end user community, the requirements will be mapped against the technologies developed to offer tailored solutions.

SAMURAI is to develop a real-time adaptive behaviour profiling and abnormality detection system for alarm event alert and prediction with much reduced false alarm. *In addition to fix-positioned CCTV cameras, the SAMURAI system will also take command input from control room operators and mobile sensory input for patrolling security staff for a hybrid context-aware based abnormal behaviour recognition.

Develop innovative tools and systems for people, vehicle and luggage detection, tracking, type categorisation across a network of cameras under real world conditions. 2. Develop an abnormal behaviour detection system based on a heterogeneous sensor network consisting of both fix-positioned CCTV cameras and mobile wearable cameras with audio and positioning sensors.

LOTUS will address the critical issue of detecting bomb (and drugs) factories. The concept and objectives of the LOTUS project are to create a system by which illicit production of explosives and drugs can be detected during the preparation and production phase of a terrorist plot. LOTUS provides intelligence of a sort that is otherwise not available. This intelligence covers a gap where little information is available from other sources. Detection in this phase has advantages compared to detection of the explosives themselves during e.g. the transportation phase. The LOTUS project main activities are measurement of the dispersion of pre-cursors at production and surveillance system development. The system capability will be demonstrated by adapting existing and emerging sensors for detection of selected precursors, and integrating the sensors in a networked system. By using existing global infrastructures for positioning (GPS) and networking (GSM) the LOTUS system can be used more or less anywhere in the world with small costs for supporting installations and personnel.

The threat scenarios will be evaluated in terms of their levels of impact and uncertainty. In conjunction with each scenarios critical early-warning indicators will be identified, namely signals that hint at a growing likelihood of specific scenarios and thus provide basis for possible prevention means.

The main goal is to contribute to the harmonization of national research policies and to the common understanding and identification of needs and priorities among its partners, which constitute the demand side of the EU technology market. EU-SEC II will carry out networking activity and set up and implement joint activities to identify common research policies in the field of security at Major Events, by addressing how end-users and suppliers could more effectively cooperate, how to encourage and direct security innovation and how to define new security standards. A further objective is to elaborate a strategic security research roadmap to guide and orientate European and national research programmes and the consequent allocation of funds. The main result of EU-SEC II will be the synchronization of end-users into a coordinated platform of EU MS to affect the other stakeholders involved in the provision of security at Major Events and to drive the European market to be more ‘requirement pulled’ than ‘technology pushed’. Moreover, the Consortium of EU-SEC II will be in the position to elaborate common security research policies and to commit its partners in future activities and calls launched at national and EU levels.

So FR teams cannot rely on a standardised environment that is common to all CI sites. This situation is quite typical in Europe and globally. Project INFRA will provide a major step towards a standard, seamless, effective and efficient FR environment, which will ensure interoperability with the CI control centre, will save lives and reduce the financial damages of catastrophic events in CI sites", "startDate": "2009-04-01", "endDate": "2011-03-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "225272", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"police\"],\"euroscivoc\":\"\",\"callId\":\"FP7-ICT-SEC-2007-1\",\"topicName\":\"ICT support for first responders in crises occurring in critical infrastructures\",\"theme\":\"Security\",\"topicCode\":\"ICT-SEC-2007-1.0-04\",\"workProgram\":\"2007\",\"callName\":\"Security systems integration, interconnectivity and interoperability\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/225272", "beneficiaries": 11.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"police\"]", "euroscivoc": null, "callId": "FP7-ICT-SEC-2007-1", "callName": "Security systems integration, interconnectivity and interoperability", "callArea": null, "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2007", "topicName": "ICT support for first responders in crises occurring in critical infrastructures", "topicCode": "ICT-SEC-2007-1.0-04"}, {"id": 50.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-225354", "name": "SERON - Security of Road Transport Networks", "amount": 2246110.0, "description": "The European road network, particularly TERN highways and TENT projects, is of major importance for the European economy and the mobility of the European citizens.

In last years a not correct management of emergencies often created critical situations. In the happening of a catastrophic event, it is human behaviour-- and often human behaviour alone--that determines the speed and efficacy of the crisis management efforts. Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise. Table top exercises are low cost and can be easily and frequently organized, but it cannot recreate the real atmosphere, (e.g. stress, confusion) and need to keep critical decisions in very little time. On the other hand, crisis managers trained through simulation exercises on the field can be very effective, but such a simulations are very expensive and cannot be easily and quickly organized. PANDORA will bridge the gap between table-top exercises and real world simulation exercises, providing a near-real training environment at affordable cost.

PREVAIL will address these scientific challenges by a novel approach. The PREVAIL concept and objectives are to prevent the use of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and acetone as precursors to homemade explosives by the development of a series of novel inhibitors, and to ensure that the detection of ammonium nitrate (AN) based devices is facilitated by adding markers tailored to a very sensitive detection system. These objectives must be met without obstructing the legitimate use or causing any adverse effects on the environment or people’s health. The PREVAIL project main activities are development and testing of markers for the inhibition of TATP production and for the concentration of HP by boiling off water (as was done for the London bombings) as well as development of novel markers for easy detection of illicit use of fertilizers. The final outcome of the PREVAIL project are inhibitors for illicit production of TATP and HP based explosives as well as novel marker/detector systems for easy detection of AN based bombs.

The DIRAC sensor will be developed to: 1) be used on the field primarily by customs officers for controls at the EU external frontiers and by law enforcement personnel for intra-Community checks as a rugged and hand-portable unit; 2) perform rapid detection of key chemicals; 3) reject interferents with minimal false positive alarm rate; 4) perform advanced data analyses such as similarity evaluation between the chemical structure of the unknown sample with that of controlled/illicit substances.

The BOOSTER project addresses this requirement under Security Topic SEC-2009-4.3.2 – Bio-dosimetric tools to manage radiological casualties. Current biodosimetric approaches frequently involve cytogenetics. The analysis of dicentric/ ring chromosomes is the mechanism of choice for precise estimation of an individual’s exposure. Current optimisation of such analyses involves the automation of various steps in the process. However, chromosome analyses are performed on the first mitosis post-exposure and thus a significant limiting factor remains a cell culture step (2 days) that is impossible to reduce. New biodosimeters are required that may not bring the same precision as cytogenetic analysis but will permit triage in the first hours post-accident into three populations (i.e. to identify individuals that require no further intervention, those who require close follow-up and those who require hospitalisation).

The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety.

Known techniques, as fluorescence will be improved by mean of novel proteins, as antibodies to extend Probability of Detection (PoD). The techniques are: 1. A low cost, high data throughput sensing technique, based on UV-Vis-NIR fluorescence. Fluorescence will be enhanced by development of Organic macro-molecules sensitive to specific classes of compounds of interest (ephedrine, pseudoephedryne, P2P, …) in the domain of drug detection. The fluorescence analysis will be based on an ‘opto-chip’ which can incorporate an array of different properly engineered fluorescent chemical protein able to bind to the analytes with an ‘immuno-type’ reaction. An array of classes of compounds can be thus very fast discriminated by one-shot measurement. 2.

New ideas and developments are needed to improve the research capabilities of the actors involved and to improve the security of European citizens in general. However, Security is also by common standards a very unusual business requiring specific rules, namely: it works on very long lead times, requires huge capital sums for developing its products and research and also requires a strong relation between all the organisations involved in the area.

In recent decades, the number of threats to aviation security has grown significantly, especially after 9/11. This has led to ever more security regulations as the threats evolve. Security procedures have become exceedingly complex and invasive to passenger privacy; the number of security measures as well as personnel and therefore costs are growing steadily. At the same time passenger and cargo traffic are expected to double in the next 15 years. Already today, security is one of the main reasons for delayed take-off. It is clear that the current complex security system cannot be adapted to such a growth without a large rise in costs. It has already and will increasingly become a major market restraint. Therefore, the proposed project COPRA aims to answer two questions: •\tHow does the threat situation in civil aviation evolve in the future, taking into account both existing and new technologies and their continuing development and proliferation? •\tWhich opportunities arise from the development and proliferation of new technologies and security procedures to overcome the current complex and expensive security situation and to enable sustainable growth for the future? COPRA’s main objective is to answer both questions in a way that will constitute the optimal balance between security, privacy, public acceptability, mobility and costs, while providing ideas on how to increase flexibility and resilience of the whole aviation system against threats. To that aim COPRA brings together a well balanced consortium of research organisations, industry and major air transport providers with a wide range of European stakeholders.

Yet new EU regulations and specifically those on information sharing between police and security forces explicitly prohibit automated decision-taking regarding individuals unless “authorised by a law which also lays down measures to safeguard the data subject’s legitimate interests” (art 7, CFD 2008/977/JHA). Where are these laws, what can these measures be and what else should the laws contain? Can the laws be technology-neutral but sector specific, thus permitting a measured approach to the appropriateness of smart surveillance technologies in key security applications? Can they be extended to all security applications of smart surveillance, even those not covered by CFD 2008/977/JHA or the proposed directive set to replace it? This project (SMART) addresses these and other questions through a comprehensive approach which combines a technical review of key application areas by sector with a review of existing pertinent legislation to then produce a set of guidelines and a model law compliant with CFD 2008/977/JHA and EU Directive 46/95 and the proposed successor legislation.

With half of the world’s population currently living in urban centres, and with this figure set to increase to two-thirds by 2050, the issue of security and citizen safety is of paramount importance and a growing concern. In view of the growing number of threats from global terrorism, natural disasters or crime, urban planning practice must incorporate appropriate security measures for vulnerability identification and resilience enhancements. Urban planning is a process involving numerous stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams. Although the use of software tools plays a significant role in this complex process, yet, none exist that take into consideration the security (and connected safety) aspects of urban planning as a whole. Urban planning teams need tools that fully encompass the pre-application process with developers/designers, and facilitate flexible solutions, not imposed measures. The objective of VITRUV is the development of software tools for the long and complex screening process, which is urban planning, moving across three levels from concept to plan to detail design. Based on an all hazard risk approach, the tools will enable planners • to make well-considered systematic qualitative decisions (concept level), • to analyse the susceptibility of urban spaces (e.g. building types, squares, public transport, and their functionalities) with respect to new threats (plan level), and • to perform vulnerability analyses of urban spaces by computing the likely damage on individuals, buildings, traffic infrastructure (detail level). All levels (concept, plan and detail) will contribute to enabling the development of more robust and resilient space in the field of urban (re)planning/(re)design/(re)engineering.

Traditional thinking and planning regarding bioterrorism has focused primarily on humans as the primary target. If the perpetrator’s objectives can be met solely through the creation of human illness, death and associated panic, this may be appropriate. However, if economic and political vulnerabilities are included as contributing factors, agricultural bioterrorism must be considered among other possible avenues of attack. Agricultural bioterrorism (agroterrorism) is a subset of bioterrorism, and it is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease/pest with the goal of generating fear, causing economic losses, and/or undermining stability. Programmes preparing for attacks against agriculture are not new, and have been conducted both by nation-states and by substate organizations throughout history. At least nine countries (Canada, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, USA and the former USSR) had documented agricultural bioweapons programmes during some part of the 20th century. Four other countries (Egypt, North Korea, Rhodesia and Syria) are believed to have or have had agricultural bioweapons programmes. In the mean time, natural outbreaks of diseases demonstrate the destructive potential of an agroterroristic attack. Recent trends in biosecurity recommend a shift from a largely national approach to biosecurity towards greater international cooperation. Current capabilities to detect and respond to agroterrorism are limited and spread among many organizations, with a corresponding lack of coordination.

The BASYLIS project aims to address these issues by developing a low-cost smart sensing platform that can automatically and effectively detect a range of security threats in complex environments. The principal obstacles to early threat detection in wide areas are of two types: functional (e.g. false-alarm rate) and ethical (e.g. privacy). Both problems are amplified when installations are dynamic or located in changing environments. Potential solutions are unaffordable to most of the potential users.

Project emphasis is on cascading events that can cause catastrophic outages of the electric power systems.  The main addressed problems are related to high impact wide spread multiple contingencies, the most significant wide area criticality. This kind of contingencies and the following cascading effects can be caused by deliberate acts of terrorism, sabotage, criminal activity, malicious behaviour etc or they can simply be caused by a combination of accidents, natural disasters, negli-gence.  Both risk analysis and risk mitigation will be pursued.  In particular, two major objectives are addressed.  The first is to develop a methodology and tool for the integrated, global vulnerability analysis and risk assessment of the interconnected Electrical Power Systems considering their interdependencies. This objective meets the TSO (Transmission System Operator) need to overcome current approaches based on separate evaluations of either power system or ICT system. Further, the adoption of risk concepts allows a more in-depth, quantitative evaluation of the security of the electrical power system.  The second objective is to develop algorithms and tools supporting contingency planning in a two-fold approach: • preventing or limiting system disruption, by means of physical security techniques and defence plans; and • re-establishing the system after a major disruption, by means of restoration plans.

The need exists for a single distributed network, with a common interface and communications protocol, to manage and communicate with a variety of different sensor technologies, and use the combined sensor data to produce clear and unequivocal results with low false positive/negative readings.  The goal of the CommonSense project is to create and demonstrate this sensor network, through the simultaneous and parallel development of novel materials, portable sensors and a wireless communications network, which uses chemometric data processing algorithms to “learn” to recognise trace amounts of explosives, and differentiate them from interferents. The partners will produce a series of novel organic, polymeric and nanocrystalline materials with tuned optoelectronic properties and surface affinities to be used as the active sensor elements. These elements will be incorporated into devices based on optical, electrical, and other readout mechanisms, for detection of airborne and waterborne analytes.  The CommonSense project will also incorporate radiation detectors to detect this growing security threat of “dirty bombs”, where sub-critical amounts of radioactive materials, obtained from medical waste or other sources, are incorporated into IEDs. The key point in the use of such a variety of sensor technologies is that no one substance can act as an interferent to all of the sensors, thus reducing false positives and negatives.

The technology proposed is based on linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry (MS). MS techniques have been increasingly deployed in security sniffing applications in the USA. MS is a non-intrusive high-resolution technique able to detect single atoms and complex molecules through their charged species (ions) or fragmentation pattern. The technique is capable of detecting a wide range of substances rapidly, with high accuracy and with a stand-off capability – critically it is able to detect trace levels below parts per million. Once the MS fingerprint of a unknown substance is measured it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. Sniffles will develop a LIT MS based device with a larger mass range than other comparable MS techniques. Methods for miniaturisation and modularisation will be applied to allow reduced vacuum demand and upgradeability. Miniaturisation will be made possible through improved designs based on results from modelling, novel manufacturing techniques and improvements in the MS drive electronics and vacuum system. These advances will bring benefits including reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility.

The proposal aims to bring this about via a combination of building up an up-to-date strategic model of how these two drugs markets currently operate, conducting interviews with counter-narcotics practicioners and field research in both the source and transit chain countries concerned, and then disseminating this research in the form of concrete policy recommendations via conference activity and publications, including a collection of conference papers and at least one major monograph.", "startDate": "2012-02-01", "endDate": "2015-01-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "285073", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"topicName\":\"Understanding of unintended consequences of global illicit-drug control measures – Capability Project\",\"topicCode\":\"SEC-2011.1.4-1\",\"callId\":\"FP7-SEC-2011-1\",\"callArea\":\"Ordinary crime and forensics\",\"theme\":\"Security\",\"callName\":\"Increasing the Security of the citizens\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\",\"workProgram\":\"2011\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285073", "beneficiaries": 7.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": "/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2011-1", "callName": "Increasing the Security of the citizens", "callArea": "Ordinary crime and forensics", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2011", "topicName": "Understanding of unintended consequences of global illicit-drug control measures – Capability Project", "topicCode": "SEC-2011.1.4-1"}, {"id": 162.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-285092", "name": "AVERT - The Autonomous Vehicle Emergency Recovery Tool (AVERT) provides a capability rapidly to deploy, extract and remove both blocking and suspect vehicles from vulnerable positions and confined spaces", "amount": 2810822.0, "description": "In Europe, terrorism threatens horrific loss of life, extensive disruption to city transport and damage to commercial real estate.

Railway infrastructure is an attractive target for EM attacks, because of its familiarity and ease of access, with extended economic and security consequences. Today, the European rail network is evolving to harmonize the management system. This is reflected by new integrated technologies, adequate procedures and centralization of command centres. The new technologies facilitate the implementation of a harmonized system and improve the network competitiveness. However, they are also highly vulnerable to EM attacks (HPM and EMP). Railway actors fear this growing EM vulnerability and have no knowledge on the extent and severity of consequences. The risk of EM attacks is also increasing due to the higher use of interoperable systems (command/control, information systems). The harmonization of the European railway network results in a harmonized EM vulnerability. Thus, a device to generate EM attacks will have the same impact anywhere in Europe, facilitating the implementation of simultaneous EM attacks.

Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.    Policy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.    The project ‘Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions’ (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas. By examining 8 urban areas throughout Europe, BESECURE will build a comprehensive and pragmatic set of indicators, and a pragmatic risk assessment model that can provide cues about the development of certain scenarios. BESECURE will improve urban security policy making by sharing best practices that are in use throughout Europe, and by providing visualisation and assessment tools and guidelines that will help local policy makers to assess the impact of their practices, and improve their decision making.", "startDate": "2012-04-01", "endDate": "2015-03-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "285222", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"topicCode\":\"SEC-2011.6.2-1\",\"callId\":\"FP7-SEC-2011-1\",\"callName\":\"Security and society\",\"topicName\":\"Best practices for enhancing security policy in urban zones\",\"theme\":\"Security\",\"callArea\":\"Organisational structure and cultures of public users\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development\",\"workProgram\":\"2011\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285222", "beneficiaries": 15.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": "/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2011-1", "callName": "Security and society", "callArea": "Organisational structure and cultures of public users", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2011", "topicName": "Best practices for enhancing security policy in urban zones", "topicCode": "SEC-2011.6.2-1"}, {"id": 175.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-285223", "name": "SECONOMICS - Socio-Economics meets Security", "amount": 3451096.14, "description": "'SECONOMICS goal is synthesizing sociological, economic and security science into a usable, concrete, actionable knowledge for policy makers and social planners responsible for citizen's security.

The result is that these crises lead to major disruption of the whole local society. The goal of ICARUS is to decrease the total cost (both in human lives and in €) of a major crisis. In order to realise this goal, the ICARUS project proposes to equip first responders with a comprehensive and integrated set of unmanned search and rescue tools, to increase the situational awareness of human crisis managers and to assist search and rescue teams for dealing with the difficult and dangerous, but life-saving task of finding human survivors. As every crisis is different, it is impossible to provide one solution which fits all needs. Therefore, the ICARUS project will concentrate on developing components or building blocks that can be directly used by the crisis managers when arriving on the field. The ICARUS tools consist of assistive unmanned air, ground and sea vehicles, equipped with human detection sensors. The ICARUS unmanned vehicles are intended as the first explorers of the area, as well as in-situ supporters to act as safeguards to human personnel.

The project addresses trace detection: it relies on the combination of two technologies based on completely different physical principles, therefore qualified as “orthogonal”: - Mid-Infrared spectroscopy technology, based on photoacoustic detection, which appears as the most powerful and promising to detect a very wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs); developments within DOGGIES will mainly target the demonstration of a widely tuneable integrated MIR source coupled with a miniature photo-acoustic cell; - Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) technology, more mature, as mentioned above; developments within DOGGIES will mainly target the use of non radio-active ionisation source. One of the main operational challenges is to provide reliable detection in real environments, in particular with the presence of “interferents”. It is expected that the use of specific pre-concentrators on one hand, and the combination of the signal emerging from these “orthogonal technologies” by advanced software on the other hand will improve the detection reliability.

Where security solutions involve the collection of information about citizens, questions arise as to whether their privacy has been infringed. This infringement of individual privacy is sometimes seen as an acceptable cost of enhanced security. Similarly, citizens are seen as willing to trade-off their privacy for enhanced personal security in different settings. These common understandings of the security-privacy relationship, both at state and citizen levels, have informed policymakers, legislative developments and best practice guidelines concerning security developments across the EU. However, an emergent body of work questions the validity of the security-privacy trade-off, suggesting that this has over-simplified the consideration of the impact and acceptability of security solutions on citizens in current security policy and practice. Thus, the more complex issues underlying privacy concerns and public scepticism towards surveillance-oriented security solutions (SOSSs) may not be apparent to legal and technological experts. In response to these developments, this project will consult with citizens from several EU member and associated states on the question of the security-privacy trade-off as they evaluate different security solutions. Through extensive preparatory work, the project will identify and empirically examine the influence of a broad range of issues upon their evaluations. Using citizen consultation meetings, questionnaires and innovative visual methods, a representative, fine-grained picture from across Europe will be provided.

While FP7 MICIE project has proved that increasing cooperation among infrastructures increases their level of service and predictive capability, it is not enough to effectively counteract threats such as cyber attacks. Such attacks could be performed blocking communication from central SCADA to local equipments or inserting fake commands/measurements in the SCADA-field equipment communications (as happened with STUXNET worm). The paradox is that critical infrastructures massively rely on the newest interconnected (and vulnerable) ICT technologies, while the control equipment is typically old, legacy software/hardware. Such a combination of factors may lead to very dangerous situations, exposing systems to a wide variety of attacks. To overcome such threats, the CockpitCI project aims on one hand to continue the work done in MICIE by refining and updating the on-line Risk Predictor deployed in the SCADA centre, on the other hand to provide some kind of intelligence to field equipment, allowing them to perform local decisions in order to self-identify and self-react to abnormal situations induced by cyber attacks.

The central aim of HARMONISE (A Holistic Approach to Resilience and Systematic ActiOns to Make Large Scale UrbaN Built Infrastructure SEcure) is to develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted, yet mutually-reinforcing concept for the enhanced security, resilience and sustainability of large scale urban built infrastructure and development. Large scale urban built infrastructure is a critical component within the intertwined networks of urban areas, which include not only physical components, but also integrated hardware and software aspects. To date, a comprehensive and holistic approach to improve the resilience and security of large scale urban developments (i.e. shopping centres/areas, sports venues or business centres with underground transportation nodes) against attacks and disruptions, has not been developed thoroughly. HARMONISE will be grounded in a holistic view of innovation, and will advocate synergies with, and augmentation of, relevant existing, past or ongoing projects. The project recognises the necessity to improve the design of urban areas and increase their security against, and resilience, to new threats. Specifically, HARMONISE seeks to deliver (a) a holistic urban resilience integrated information platform; (b) a suite of innovative tools (toolkit hosted within the HARMONISE platform); (c) greater understanding and awareness of urban security and resilience vis-a-vis dissemination activities; and, (d) commercialisation opportunities among emerging new markets in this field.

The objective of TeraSCREEN is to combine these two capabilities, thus providing automatic detection and classification of body-borne threats for security screening. This will significantly improve both efficiency and security at border checks. TeraSCREEN aims to develop passive and active operation at several Terahertz frequencies. The resulting multi-frequency, multi-mode images will be processed automatically in real-time to reveal the location of potentially harmful objects concealed on a person. Privacy Enhancing Technologies will be used: the information will be displayed to the operator on a generic computerised silhouette and no anatomical details will be shown or saved. Terahertz radiation is non-ionizing, and reliable studies have shown that active operation in this frequency band is harmless to humans. The automatic recognition of threats, in addition to removing privacy issues, reduces the level of attention required from the operator, which implies a reduction in the personnel necessary for continuous operation. The TeraSCREEN Prototype System will be demonstrated at a live control point in Bristol International Airport.

In particular, harmonisation would be required in areas as e-passports management, biometrics, gate design, human interface, processes, PKD certificate exchange, signalling and interoperability. On the other hand, EU Smart Border Initiative adds a new approach to be considered in ABC development: The inclusion of a RTP system for Third Country Nationals and an Entry Exit System. ABC4EU will identify the requirements for an integrated, interoperable and citizen’s rights respectful ABC system at EU level, taking account of the experience gained from the previous pilots, projects and the future needs derived from the Smart Border and other EU and national initiatives and paying very special attention to citizen rights, privacy and other related ethical aspects. ABC4EU will focus in the need for harmonisation in the design and operational features of ABC Gates, considering specially the full exploitation of the EU second generation passports and other accepted travel documents. In addition, RTP and EES will be specifically tested in the project to assess their feasibility and an EU level border management C4I concept will be developed for end user assessment.

A key challenge in forensics is the detection of trace explosive residues at a post-blast scene or on the hands or clothes of an alleged suspect. Detection of the primer charge (e.g., PETN) is often hampered by higher-concentration residues from the main charge, e.g., ammonium nitrate. Detection of the primer can be essential in order to secure a prosecution, especially if the materials that comprise the main charge are commonly available, e.g., ammonium nitrate is present in fertiliser. ROSFEN’s goal is to deliver an advanced forensic platform for rapid, on-site direct detection and lab-quality analysis of narcotics, explosives and their precursors. The performance targets are detection limits down to 1 ng/mL, 1% false alarm rate and response time < 10 seconds. ROSFEN combines innovative technology from two leading SMEs: Microsaic Systems’ chip-based mass spectrometry and Environics’ ion filter systems. This novel platform removes the need for slow, costly chromatography methods currently used in lab-based analysis. ROSFEN will enable reduction of total analysis time (samples, blanks, controls) from hours to minutes, thus reducing the load on forensic labs and enabling intelligence-led investigations. ROSFEN will also innovate in the rapid analysis of new psychoactive drugs, by coupling the isomer selectivity of the ion filter technique with the detection sensitivity of tandem MS. ROSFEN will thus enable European industry to develop and deliver innovative technologies into key global markets: Analytical instruments for security applications ($2 billion annually) and the $3.3B market for mass spectrometry. The ROSFEN consortium comprises two research-intensive SMEs, two leading research groups and two end users.

At the very early response stages voice communications are critical, after which non-voice communications are an important requirement dependent on the nature of the disaster. As most mobile telecommunications networks located in a disaster area are designed to support normal traffic loads, they will not have the capacity to provide effective PPDR communications. As disasters require effective co-ordination, support and communication between all agencies involved, it would be ideal if one communication solution could be provided to meet all needs. Radio communications networks used by public safety and the emergency services will normally be used to provide Public Protection. Most public safety organisations have the capability to rapidly deploy mobile communications network elements to provide additional capacity and/or maintain communications if the main network fails.

The increase of criminal activity is manifested in an increased frequency of small crimes like graffiti, theft, robbery, destruction of rubbish bins. This has had a big impact for local governments, citizens and businesses. Local government agencies are trying to solve these problems. As was shown in New York, a reduction in petty crimes increases the sense of public order which produces further reduction in crime in general. These organizations often treat the problem with classical solutions such as increase in police resources, reintegration of offenders, rehabilitation of degraded areas and modern solutions such as urban video surveillance. However, these new technologies are often underused and inadequate.

Rather than providing new methodologies or tools, SmartPrevent will focus on: a) improving already-existing methodologies by means of a set of guidelines for the use of video-surveillance systems; and b) providing a set of tools capable to improve of the existing crime detection systems.

Up to now, research on the protective gear of this group concentrated on the ballistic properties of the body armour. However, in spite of the improvements, modern body armours still have some of the same drawbacks as the old ones, as they are mostly heavy, bulky and rigid. Therefore they limit the wearer’s mobility and agility and are impractical for use on joints, arms, legs, etc. Moreover, body armours have traditionally been designed to protect the wearer against ballistic threats and, thus, they provide only a limited level of protection against knives, sharp blades or sharp-tipped weapons. Recent studies, however, reveal that stab and puncture have become a main cause of police officers' injuries. Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop materials that combine stab and ballistic protection, while retaining their flexibility and low weight. In this context, the proposed project aims to develop optimized ballistic textiles (both woven and spacer knitted fabrics) and apply innovative surface treatments (e.g. shear thickening fluids, ceramic coatings) to improve their performance on an areal density basis. Thus, fewer fabric layers will be required, which is expected to result in increased flexibility and reduced weight of the armour. Main parameters to consider also include physiological comfort and ergonomic design. Additionally, smart functions, including positioning systems, will be integrated to further increase the efficiency of the body armour, eventually leading to reduced casualties. Finally, while a main limitation is that existing protective gear is usually limited to the body armour, innovative solutions are herein proposed for the protection of vulnerable body parts other than the torso.'", "startDate": "2014-04-01", "endDate": "2017-09-30", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "607295", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"police\"],\"workProgram\":\"2013\",\"callName\":\"Security of citizens\",\"callArea\":\"Ordinary crime and forensics\",\"theme\":\"Security\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/engineering and technology/materials engineering/coating and films\",\"topicCode\":\"SEC-2013.1.4-1\",\"callId\":\"FP7-SEC-2013-1\",\"topicName\":\"Smart and protective clothing for law enforcement and first responders – Capability Project\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607295", "beneficiaries": 10.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"police\"]", "euroscivoc": "/engineering and technology/materials engineering/coating and films", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Security of citizens", "callArea": "Ordinary crime and forensics", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2013", "topicName": "Smart and protective clothing for law enforcement and first responders – Capability Project", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.1.4-1"}, {"id": 274.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-607406", "name": "CAMINO - Comprehensive Approach to cyber roadMap coordINation and develOpment", "amount": 1036888.0, "description": "The major goal of the project is to provide a realistic roadmap for improving resilience against cybercrime and cyber terrorism.

Indeed, while some assurance approaches have been implemented in a few countries, they remain insufficient to provide breeder documents in complete security and trustworthiness at a time when this is increasingly necessary.

The identification of common security gaps will lead to the recommendation of possible solutions to overcome the security weaknesses in breeder documents. The project will provide support for issuance bodies and border control communities. It will also promote the standardisation of breeder documents by creating a dedicated working group at a European level.

SIIP multiplies and increases the information sharing and cooperation in the LEA community and speeds up the use of Speaker Identification by LEAs in Europe not only for individual identification but also for authentication. SIIP runs on all speech sources (e.g. Internet, PSTN, Cellular and SATCOM) and uses the latest OSINT data mining applications to obtain and corroborate voice samples. The SIIP consortium consists of 17 partners bringing together end-users, SME’s, industrial and academic partners from a variety of fields including Speech analytics, Social Media Analytics and Integration. To maximize its impact, SIIP will be designed, developed and tested with INTERPOL and police forces in the UK and Portugal, taking into account the various EU legal/ethical aspects and Interpol regulations.", "startDate": "2014-05-01", "endDate": "2018-04-30", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "607784", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"police\"],\"workProgram\":\"2013\",\"callName\":\"Security systems integration, interconnectivity and interoperability\",\"topicCode\":\"SEC-2013.5.1-2\",\"theme\":\"Security\",\"topicName\":\"Audio and voice analysis, speaker identification for security applications – Integration Project\",\"callArea\":\"Information management\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/humanities/languages and literature/linguistics/phonetics\",\"callId\":\"FP7-SEC-2013-1\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607784", "beneficiaries": 20.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"police\"]", "euroscivoc": "/humanities/languages and literature/linguistics/phonetics", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Security systems integration, interconnectivity and interoperability", "callArea": "Information management", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2013", "topicName": "Audio and voice analysis, speaker identification for security applications – Integration Project", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.5.1-2"}, {"id": 295.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-607798", "name": "DRIVER+ - DRiving InnoVation in crisis management for European Resilience", "amount": 33468209.0, "description": "DRIVER\\ starts from the experience that neither successful R&D nor strong end-user demand always lead to innovation in the Crisis Management (CM) domain. This is a problem since as societies become more complex, increasing scope and unpredictability of potential crises and faster dynamics of major incidents put increasingly stringent demands on CM. European CM capabilities already constitute a mature System of Systems; hence wholesale redesign would often be too costly and might critically destabilise existing CM capabilities. Therefore DRIVER\\ focuses on augmenting rather than replacing existing capabilities. DRIVER\\ has three main objectives: 1) Develop a pan-European Test-bed for crisis management capability development; 2) Develop a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of crisis management solutions, and 3) Facilitate a shared understanding of crisis management across Europe.  The DRIVER\\ Test-bed will provide the technological infrastructure, the necessary supporting methodology and adequate support tools. The Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) is a database driven web site that documents all the available DRIVER\\ solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the trials. Initially, the PoS will contain information about the solutions that are already available within the consortium; the PoS will be extended with third-party solutions when required by the trials, and ultimately opened up for any external organisation to share data and experiences on solutions.  A series of trials will be conducted during which solutions will be operationalised and tested. All results of the trials will be stored and made available in the PoS. Several I4CM events will be organized as well as a final conference. In addition to this, a firm link is established and will be maintained with DG HOME’s “Community of Users on Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies” and other European stakeholder groups and relevant initiatives, for instance on standardization.  To maximise impact beyond the scope of the project and of the DRIVER\\ consortium it is necessary to develop the sustainability of the European Test-bed, the exploitation of the DRIVER Portfolio of Solutions and to promote a European CM community, which shares a common CM understanding and is increasingly willing to share capabilities and collaborate in CM innovation. Together this will boost Europe’s ability to continue adapting to new threats and emerging needs, laying the basis for a continuously resilient EU and providing a mechanism to drive innovation in European CM by bridging the gap from practitioners need and R&D to the market.", "startDate": "2014-05-01", "endDate": "2020-04-30", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "607798", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"crisis management\"],\"workProgram\":\"2013\",\"topicCode\":\"SEC-2013.4.1-1\",\"theme\":\"Security\",\"topicName\":\"Phase II demonstration programme on aftermath crisis management\",\"callArea\":\"Preparedness, prevention, mitigation and planning\",\"callName\":\"Restoring security and safety in case of crisis\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\",\"callId\":\"FP7-SEC-2013-1\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607798", "beneficiaries": 42.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"crisis management\"]", "euroscivoc": "/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Restoring security and safety in case of crisis", "callArea": "Preparedness, prevention, mitigation and planning", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2013", "topicName": "Phase II demonstration programme on aftermath crisis management", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.4.1-1"}, {"id": 296.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-607799", "name": "PULSE - Platform for European Medical Support during major emergencies", "amount": 2789940.0, "description": "In Europe, one of the core emergency response services to deadly threats such as pandemic disease and major terrorism attacks is the European Health Services (EHS). The EHS comprise key stakeholders that include hospitals, community health services, pre-hospital emergency care services, medical suppliers, rescue services, health related voluntary services and others. It is crucial to the EHS that it remains in an excellent state of preparedness supported by first-class planning and decision support tools. Moreover, in the response phase, EHS need consistent, coordinated and standardised advanced support methods and tools providing support in critical tasks like e.g. early threat detection, common operational picture, creation of surge capacity etc. Finally, at a pan European level, EHS also need an interoperable framework with the ability to provide a coordinated European response to any major medical incident.  PULSE aims to meet these challenges.  The project will begin by a) comprehensively studying the procedures, processes and training requirements in current operation at the EHS using the support of end users available to the project. It will then b):  • Develop standard and consistent response procedures and processes; • Provide tools to support decision making in both preparedness and response phases; • Provide a Framework that ensures decision makers have access to timely key data, planning and decision support tools and to international best practice and lessons learnt; • Present innovative training techniques to improve personnel response training; • Develop an ‘emergency app’ for smart phones that will allow users fast and flexible access to emergency resource availability information;  The primary benefit will: • Reduce administration, bureaucracy and ensure better use of resources; The project will: • Build on research results from previous EU projects which have developed usable analysis of societal and political criteria and their relevance to security measures -Capture and assess lessons learnt.

This project will undertake humanitarian policy analysis on a global and regional scale, examining ways in which these policies support or undermine development and international security. It will also implement population-based studies in key crises-affected areas to obtain field evidence.  Research will focus on health and educational policies. Many crises and conflicts entail a substantial degradation in human and social capital, creating barriers to post-conflict recovery and stabilization. The instant re-establishment of access to primary and secondary education, as well as to basic health services, is vital as these are tangible peace dividends. Offering young people real opportunities aside from warfare, and lowering the burden of disease and mortality in war-torn populations dries up the breeding ground of violence and conflict.

At best, there are automatic solutions to avoid abrupt incidents. Incipient as well as intermittent fault detection and isolation still occurs randomly. Also, more than 50% of Europe’s ageing infrastructure has been built before 1983, while gas consumption continues to grow. Regarding safety, although the standards and regulations enable to mostly avoid abrupt failures, the current maintenance requirements incur excessive costs for gas grid operators. E.g. in Germany, grid leakages are controlled by expensive airborne LIDAR monitoring systems. This is especially problematic in urban environments, in which most of the consumers are situated- without viable alternatives, grid operators must accept the cost.  Nevertheless, recent advancements in remote measurement technologies enable to develop substantially more effective grid monitoring solutions. For example, THE Systems and its team has already proven the viability of networked accelerometers for continuous grid monitoring tasks (THE Systems has tested the solution in an industrial environment in Finland).  As a result of this project, THE Systems will combine state of the art accelerometers with advanced signal processing based on computationally efficient algorithms. The uniqueness for urban settings stems from the nodes’ highly effective dampening features and the algorithm’s non-parametric, multivariate, and non-linear characteristics that operate despite high rates of random noise. Thus, it will be possible for grid operators to continuously detect and isolate faults in urban gas networks in an economically feasible manner. The broader impact will be an increase in urban gas grid safety, and at least a 50% reduction in respective grid maintenance costs. For THE Systems, TM Field Analyzer could generate up to 70 mEUR by year 5 after the product launch, and increase the number of staff by at least 70 employees.", "startDate": "2014-10-01", "endDate": "2015-02-28", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "651414", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"euroscivoc\":\"/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas\",\"callArea\":\"\",\"workProgram\":\"2014-15\",\"topicCode\":\"DRS-17-2014-1\",\"callId\":\"\",\"topicName\":\"SME instrument topic: “Protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures”\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callName\":\"Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/651414", "beneficiaries": 1.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": "/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "topicName": "SME instrument topic: “Protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures”", "topicCode": "DRS-17-2014-1"}, {"id": 328.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-651669", "name": "CAPTOR - cAPTor captures Advanced System Threats", "amount": 50000.0, "description": "CAPTOR is a set of tools whose main objective is to characterize, identify and detect APT’s as well as minimize their impact in the target organization.

These will improve the ability of stakeholders to anticipate, monitor, respond, adapt, learn and evolve, to operate efficiently in the face of crises. Guidelines will be presented in formats for easy usage and maintenance to avoid them being dust-collectors on a shelf. To enable dynamic, user-friendly guidelines the project will adapt innovative tools (e.g. serious gaming, training packages), test and validate the guidelines, and establish knowledge about how organisations can implement guidelines to improve resilience.   A multidisciplinary approach is applied, involving experts in the field of resilience, crisis and risk management, social media and service providers in the Air Traffic Management and health care domains. To ensure transnational, cross-sector applicability, long-term relevance and uptake of project results, a Community of Crisis and Resilience Practitioners (CoCRP) will be established, including stakeholders and end-users from other domains and critical infrastructures and resilience experts. The CoCRP will be involved in an iterative evaluation process to provide feedback on the guidelines.  The target beneficiaries of DARWIN are crisis management actors and stakeholders responsible for public safety, such as critical infrastructures and service providers, which might be affected by a crisis, as well as the public and media.   The project duration will be 36 months, requesting financing of €4.9M.", "startDate": "2015-06-01", "endDate": "2018-09-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "653289", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"crisis management\"],\"topicCode\":\"DRS-07-2014\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"topicName\":\"Crises and disaster resilience – operationalizing resilience concepts\",\"workProgram\":\"2014-15\",\"callName\":\"Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change\",\"callId\":\"\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport/transport planning/air traffic management\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653289", "beneficiaries": 10.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"crisis management\"]", "euroscivoc": "/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport/transport planning/air traffic management", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "topicName": "Crises and disaster resilience – operationalizing resilience concepts", "topicCode": "DRS-07-2014"}, {"id": 338.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-653321", "name": "WISER - Wide-Impact cyber SEcurity Risk framework", "amount": 2562596.0, "description": "WISER delivers a cyber-risk management framework able to assess, monitor and mitigate the risks in real time, in multiple industries.

Law enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are still using conventional, manpower based techniques to gather forensic evidence. Concealed surveillance devices can provide irrefutable evidences, but current video surveillance systems are usually bulky and complicated, are often used as simple video recorders, and require complex, expensive infrastructure to supply power, bandwidth, storage and illumination.  Recent years have seen significant advances in the surveillance industry, but these were rarely targeted to forensic applications. The imaging community is fixated on cameras for mobile phones, where the figures of merit are resolution, image quality, and low profile. A mobile phone with its camera on would consume its battery in under two hours. Industrial surveillance cameras are even more power hungry, while intelligent algorithms such as face detection often require extremely high processing power, such as backend server farms, and are not available in conventional surveillance systems.   Here we propose to develop and validate a novel, ultra-low-power, intelligent, miniaturised, low-cost, wireless, autonomous sensor (“FORENSOR”) for evidence gathering. Its ultra-sensitive camera and built-in intelligence will allow it to operate at remote locations, automatically identify pre-defined criminal events, and alert LEAs in real time while providing and storing the relevant video, location and timing evidence. FORENSOR will be able to operate for up to two months with no additional infrastructure. It will be manageable remotely, preserve the availability and the integrity of the collected evidence, and comply with all legal and ethical standards, in particular those related to privacy and personal data protection.

Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs.  The goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes. The use of sophisticated proxy cryptography schemes will enable a secure and privacy preserving information sharing network for cloud-based identity information in which even the identity provider cannot access the data in plain-text and hence protect access to identity data. We focus not only on evaluating and applying novel crypto-approaches for IAMs but also on implementing them in an easy-to-use way to motivate secure handling of identity data.  In order to also address security, privacy and trust issues related to the used cloud platforms and services we will investigate assurance and resilience approaches for enhancing underlying cloud services.

Unfortunately, there is currently no solution available on the market that allows neither the comprehensive assessment of Social Vulnerabilities nor the management and reduction of the associated risk.  DOGANA aims to fill this gap by developing a framework that delivers 'aDvanced sOcial enGineering And vulNerability Assessment'. The underlying concept of DOGANA is that Social Vulnerabilities Assessments (SVAs), when regularly performed with the help of an efficient framework, help deploy effective mitigation strategies and lead to reducing the risk created by modern Social Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. Two relevant features of the proposed framework are: i) the presence of the 'awareness' component within the framework as the cornerstone of the mitigation activities; ii) the legal compliance by design of the whole framework, that will be ensured by a partner and a work package explicitly devoted to this task. Moreover, the outcomes of the project are also expected to provide a solid basis to revise the insurance models for cyber-attacks related risks, thanks to the involvement of 2 strong DOGANA partners in this area of activity.  The project will be implemented by a consortium of 18 partners, from 11 different countries, including users, technology providers of whom 3 are major world-wide cyber-security solutions market leaders as well as legal and psychological expertise. An extensive field trial plan enables the testing of the DOGANA platform with six users (4 partners and 2 supporting users) operating in the critical areas of energy, finance, transport, utilities, and public authorities. DOGANA has also created a unique consortium with a world-wide scope.

Yet these apps are characterised by a predominantly Anglo-Saxon approach with the largest number originating in the USA, a few in Canada, Australia and with the UK apparently the only major EU state where there has been some take-up of these technologies. CITYCoP sets out to find out why the EU appears to be lagging behind although Community Policing is nominally a policy which has been put into action in a number of EU countries. It then goes on to develop a solution including a new smartphone app and on-line portal which are capable of being deployed in any European city while still retaining “local flavour” and diversity. These ICT solutions will also be designed from scratch to be fully compliant with strict privacy and data protection laws. A training scheme, including use of serious games, will be developed to assist training of officers and citizens in use of the app and portal. CITYCoP will benefit from a multi-disciplinary approach that will include the sociology of community policing as well as cognitive science perspectives of the citizen’s interaction with community and LEAs through technology.

Our innovative solution meets these needs by providing a value for money, light sensitive sensor that produces high definition images of non-illuminated areas at night and in low light conditions. Current technology suffers from poor light conversion and sensitivity therefore, to see at night and in low light conditions, the scene needs to be illuminated. Our proposal is to improve sensitivity by using sensors with organic compounds that are sensitive to background sky radiation (1.5 micron). We will also develop Application Specific Integrated Circuits to process the sensor output. The novelty in our innovation is the integration of new technologies and the processing of data produced by a 1.5 micron organic sensor. This will deliver high resolution images at night and in low light conditions. Our solution will reduce the energy required to illuminate urban soft targets and critical infrastructure. Added benefits include a reduction in light pollution and that surveillance can be carried out in areas which have lighting restrictions. The development of a proven, production ready system is the ultimate aim of the project. In Phase 1 we will carry out a feasibility study to verify the technological, practical and economic viability of our proposal. Our feasibility study will consider the results of relevant European and International research. We plan to further develop our prototype and carry out a small-scale demonstration of our innovative solution.

Liquid contamination in pipelines is a serious issue for safety, security, reliability of supply and commercially for gas supply and transportation companies. Existing technology is designed only to analyse dry gas. Liquid contamination damages the analysers and sample systems and there is no indication of the quantity of liquid present. Early detection of contamination is key and will result in the issue being dealt with before it becomes a commercial problem and most importantly an urgent safety or security issue.  The Linevu system introduces a non-intruding vision system at various points in the pipeline in order to determine if a liquid is present in the pipeline, so that the correct course of action can be decided upon before it becomes a serious issue.  Our goal is to embark on a phase 2 project in order to bring to market a novel pressurised window, containment system and vision system which can confirm the presence of liquid, while not interfering with routine “pigging” maintenance in the pipeline. The safety, economic and social benefits are numerous and the system would be retro-fitted onto any existing pipelines in the global supply network.

Besides, potential terrorists might threaten water infrastructure in European cities, since poisoning the tap water is a low-cost attack that easily generates social panic and economic loss to the society. Due to lack of the ideal early warning tools on water safety, large amount of routine sampling and testing have to be done frequently to fight against possible CBRN threats on urban water supply. This project addresses feasibility study for the technical and economic viability of Biological Water Alarm System (BiWAS): An innovative low-cost early warning device for monitoring of drinking water safety over a broad spectrum of harmful substances, including (1) acute toxicant chemicals, (2) chronic carcinogenic chemicals, and (3) waterborne pathogens. The innovative content of BiWAS lies in the miniaturisation and integration with multidisciplinary knowledge, which makes BiWAS a continuous, automatic and portable device working for long period with only annually or biannually maintenance. The potential customers include public water suppliers, household users, hospitals, hotels, culinary and food industries, etc. An early warning system against CBRN threats in drinking water can be realized without more investment. A feasibility assessment on BiWAS product under Phase 1 includes market investigation, business plan development, risk assessment, intellectual property management and innovation strategy development. In the potential Phase 2, a commercializable prototype of BiWAS will be expected, which can be probably the first low-cost and broad-spectrum early warning device for water safety. With the outcome of Phase 1, it will guide the European companies towards the leading role of the global water quality monitoring techniques, and open a big door to the large market of global water quality monitoring, from Europe to the world.", "startDate": "2015-02-01", "endDate": "2015-07-31", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "664032", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"workProgram\":\"2014-15\",\"callName\":\"Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change\",\"topicCode\":\"DRS-17-2014-1\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\",\"topicName\":\"SME instrument topic: “Protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures”\",\"callId\":\"\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/664032", "beneficiaries": 2.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": "/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "topicName": "SME instrument topic: “Protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures”", "topicCode": "DRS-17-2014-1"}, {"id": 383.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-666490", "name": "AquaSHIELD - Protecting citizens against intentional drinking water contamination with a water quality firewall", "amount": 786195.0, "description": "Critical water infrastructures and high profile (soft) targets are vulnerable to intentional drinking water contamination.

In light of increasing security threats there is a strong need amongst water suppliers and authorities, in Europe and globally, for a contaminant warning system that can be deployed in the distribution network and that provides real-time water quality information and event classification to support rapid decision making and protect the health of citizens.  AquaSHIELD is based on an innovative and awarded optical sensor technology developed by Dutch optical sensor company Optisense, and is unique in combining 24/7 online event detection and high spec analytical capabilities for multiple substances in an affordable platform suitable for deployment in the field and for operation by non-specialist personnel.  The AquaSHIELD solution integrates two sub-components that have already been tested and validated by leading water companies in the Netherlands and Singapore, and will consist of a generic sensor for online real-time detection of contamination events, online monitoring of chlorine residual as indicator for micro-biological contaminations, and rapid screening capability for a set of high priority threat substances.

ACES has been developed to identify explosive threats with sensitivity and discrimination power orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art systems. It is unmatched in its ability to screen large volumes in minutes, such as cargo containers and whole trucks, without disassembly. This line of business is backed up both by a very high social demand and a strong institutional support: explosive screening for aeronautical cargo loaded in passenger aircrafts is mandatory in the EU and nearly all nations. This inspection task is presently executed carried out by X-ray screening, which presents two relevant deficiencies: 1) the cargo load must be broken down into pieces where the maximum side is lower than 120 cm, and 2) a human operator interprets the X-ray image, in order to detect an arbitrarily shaped explosive a few centimeters in size, seen with a depth of 120 cm.

To fully estimate the security of an enterprise’s system architecture, a large number of issues must be considered. Enterprise systems security managers must be able to assess how vulnerabilities in one system influence vulnerabilities in other systems. In addition, security managers must be able to assess how individual vulnerabilities influence the security of the entire system of systems, given the protection solutions that are used in different locations in the architecture.

There is a major security requirement is for a new reliable detection method of explosives, especially at soft targets. The ideal solution is a robust in-situ method for rapid non-invasive detection of hazardous materials, including explosives, that is portable and can be located at borders, ports and other sensitive targets around Europe. The most powerful and promising method being adopted for in-situ observations of suspicious substances to detect explosive is Raman spectroscopy. All molecules provide a unique Raman signature making the method very flexible and effective. However, Raman observations thus far have proven unreliable in the field, due to the very weak signal strength, background fluorescence masking this signal and complicated spectral returns that are difficult to interpret in the field.  In this project ISI will seek to develop an Advanced Intelligent Raman system (AIRS) that builds on the strengths of the Raman observational approach, and dramatically reduces it current limitations of existing instrumentation.  AIRS will achieve this by combining three technology development to produce a new portable easy to use chemical identification instrument. Specifically the instrument will use a Time resolved measurement technique using advanced detector technologies to remove the fluorescence and improve the signal to noise of observations.

The present project proposes the development of a new protection system called CYPRES. The proposed CYPRES is one of the first products able to protect specifically industrial automation systems. It uses Artificial Intelligence combined with the real condition of the process to detect discrepancies that reveal intrusions or attacks, even as slow or small as a malware can be. To perform well, CYPRES must be engineered for each type of process.  The development comprises design specifications and development of the CYPRES core-product subsequent to a thorough market study followed by a commercial product specific to Electricity networks protection, then another for Water and wastewater systems. Further processes will be developed later on. Cypres is a cost-worthy add-on solution for existing and new SCADA.  CYPRES is developed by a consortium of two experienced French SMEs working in Industrial Automation, Software development and cyber-security offering a solid basis for the technical, financial and development challenge that CYPRES represents.

There is strong demand in the banking industry for secure biometric applications. In fact, in May 2014 the European Central Bank (ECB) published a list of recommendations for increased bank transaction security and for the first time, biometrics was included as one of most valid and securest authentication parameters. Security has been always a major concern of the banking industry, fundamentally because banks are attractive to criminals as a direct access to currency, bank notes, and user‘s personal information which can be used for identity theft (phishing and card skimming). The concerns about bank security have always been there, but it has been after the breakthrough of online and mobile banking when bank fraud has become major issue to address with urgency. Currently, whether it’s online, on a smartphone, on an ATM or on a POS (point-of-sale), the great majority of banking transactions are done by using a 4-6 digits PIN code as the way for authentication. This form of authentication is of an extremely low security level in all cases, but especially more in online banking where cybercriminals and hackers can easily obtain this PIN code in a matter of seconds. As a result, the total value of fraudulent transactions is rapidly increasing year by year, being now estimated at €1.33 billion solely in Europe. In this scenario, biometrics holds great promise to become the gold standard authentication method for bank transactions in the near future. However, despite the clear opportunity there are still some barriers preventing the banking biometrics breakthrough, at least on a large scale.

All of the cases of theft of nuclear materials where the circumstances of the theft are known were perpetrated either by insiders or with the help of insiders; given that the other cases involve bulk material stolen covertly without anyone being aware the material was missing, there is every reason to believe that they were perpetrated by insiders as well.  The need is to detect shielded and unshielded Special Nuclear Materials ('SNM') and radioactive materials is necessary. Radiation Monitors are effective to detect unshielded or partially shielded nuclear and radioactive materials in lightly loaded vehicles or cargos, and less effective at dense or high attenuating vehicles. In addition, the radiation monitors are not effective to detect shielding (e.g. lead) inside the vehicles that are capable to transport large masses of shielding material. Specifically, one of the biggest gaps is that some SNMs emit very low level of radiation. The X-ray cannot clear every dense object found in the image. Active interrogation can be used to clear the alarms; however, they produce high radiation that requires shielded facility, and require passengers not to remain in the vehicle during the inspection. Therefore, there is a need for inspection systems that can penetrate high attenuating vehicles, be specific to nuclear and shielding materials and that can be steal from the sites. . Lingacom is developing an innovative Muon Detection System for detecting high-Z materials used in nuclear bombs and shielded radioactive materials (used in “dirty bombs”) in containerized cargo and vehicles.

Despite some promising approaches, still no proven method of leakages and exfiltration measurement on a wider scale is available so authorities and companies are not aware of its impact on groundwater pollution. Indirect measuring methods as groundwater sampling or modelling, are mostly too complicated for sewer operators to apply. Direct procedures yield exfiltration rates for single leaks, but the extrapolation to overall exfiltration rates is questionable due to the inhomogeneity of defects. Our technology is based on an ongoing monitoring plan to anticipate the consequences of leakages. With the ambition of reducing the amount of Contaminants of Emerging Concern that can cause harm to the environment and human populations, and based on practical experience acquired through the Western Galilee Incident where R.Z.E.E. professionals detected an alarmant percentage of leakages (20%), we developed and patented an unique technology, “Any Geometry Flume”, a system adapted to measure gravitational flows in a simple, precise and relatively inexpensive way.

As maritime smuggling from Morocco towards the European borders of Portugal and Spain was combatted more effectively, the criminal modus operandi changed drastically, approaching air routes with cheap and small planes. New drone technology opens opportunity to both manned and unmanned airborne drug transports. Launched from any location and moving at low altitude and speed to mask their presence with the present clutter environment, drones can autonomously reach any landing site under nearly all circumstances. The ALFA system bridges this detection capability gap by drastically improving the situational awareness through the detection of LSS (Low, Small and Slow) manned and unmanned aircraft. ALFA is future-ready as technologies for drone detection will be a part of the system, which will use heterogeneous, easy-to-deploy mobile sensors based on several novel technologies. All sensor data, augmented by other existing sources of information, will be combined using evolved data fusion, providing accurate positional data for targets including eventual indication of the air vehicle type and reliable prediction of its landing site. This information will be communicated to the regional law enforcement units using a secure communication link and mobile device application, drastically improving the reaction time. Final ALFA capabilities will be demonstrated in a realistic operational context using relevant targets and in close cooperation with two principal end users taking part in the consortium.

PROTECTIVE makes two key contributions to achieve this enhanced situational awareness. Firstly it increases the computer security incident response team’s (CSIRT) threat awareness through improved security monitoring and increased sharing of threat intelligence between organisations within a community. Secondly it ranks critical alerts based on the potential damage the attack can inflict on the threatened assets and hence to the organisations business. High impact alerts that target important hosts will have a higher priority than other alerts. Through the combination of these two measures organisations are better prepared to handle incoming attacks, malware outbreaks and other security problems and to guide the development of the prevention and remediation processes. The PROTECTIVE system is designed to provide solutions for public domain CSIRTs and SME’s who both have needs outside the mainstream of cyber security solution provision. Public CSIRTs needs arise in part because commercial tools do not address their unique requirements. This has created a shortfall, clearly articulated by ENISA, of tools with the required analytical and visualisation capabilities to enable public CSIRTs provide optimised services to their constituency.

The SHIELD virtual security infrastructure can either used by the ISP internally for network monitoring and protection, but it can also be offered as-a-service to ISP customers; for this purpose, SHIELD establishes a “vNSF Store”, i.e. a repository of available virtual security functions (firewalls, DPIs, content filters etc.) from which the ISP customers can select the ones which best match their needs and deploy them to protect their infrastructure. This approach promotes openness and interoperability of security functions and offers an affordable, zero-CAPEX security solution for citizens and SMEs. Moreover, SHIELD services can be easily scaled up or down, configured and upgraded according to customers’ needs, as opposed to security solutions based on monolithic hardware.", "startDate": "2016-09-01", "endDate": "2019-02-28", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "700199", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"topicName\":\"Information driven Cyber Security Management\",\"callName\":\"Digital Security: Cybersecurity, Privacy and Trust\",\"callArea\":\"\",\"workProgram\":\"2014-15\",\"callId\":\"\",\"topicCode\":\"DS-04-2015\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/network security\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700199", "beneficiaries": 12.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": "/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/network security", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security: Cybersecurity, Privacy and Trust", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "topicName": "Information driven Cyber Security Management", "topicCode": "DS-04-2015"}, {"id": 425.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-700256", "name": "I-REACT - Improving Resilience to Emergencies through Advanced Cyber Technologies", "amount": 5393866.75, "description": "Society as a whole is increasingly exposed and vulnerable to natural disasters because extreme weather events, exacerbated by climate change, are becoming more frequent and longer.

Most academic and policy initiatives to date have focused on the direct security impacts of climate change in Third Countries and/or on the indirect impacts on international security (e.g. concerning regional economic or political stability). While those initiatives offer invaluable insights, CLISEL is based on the presumption that many indirect impacts on Europe’s security emerge and are felt at the local scale, within Europe itself. This is overlooked by most existing initiatives on the so called climate-security nexus, and the conditions under which local authorities act upon climate change (in)security within their operations are not well understood.   To fill this gap, CLISEL explores the climate-security nexus from the perspective of local administrations and communities, based on the idea that innovations in the exercise of regulatory power of local authorities can contribute to enhance the understanding of the indirect security implications of climate change in Third countries, as well as to take proactive action. In particular, CLISEL looks at the issue of climate-induced migration, an issue often cited as an indirect security dimension of climate change, from the perspective of local administrators in Sardinia. The aim is to understand the extent to which migrants from ecologically vulnerable Third Countries are perceived as a security issue, the reasons why that is (not) the case, as well as the policies and actions through which local administrators can ward off the emergence of security crisis within their territory.", "startDate": "2016-05-01", "endDate": "2019-04-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "700385", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"euroscivoc\":\"/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology/climatic changes\",\"topicCode\":\"DRS-22-2015\",\"workProgram\":\"2014-15\",\"callName\":\"Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change\",\"topicName\":\"Impact of climate change in third countries on Europe's security\",\"callId\":\"\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700385", "beneficiaries": 5.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": "/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology/climatic changes", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "topicName": "Impact of climate change in third countries on Europe's security", "topicCode": "DRS-22-2015"}, {"id": 438.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-700389", "name": "ResiStand - Increasing disaster Resilience by establishing a sustainable process to support Standardisation of technologies and services", "amount": 1962553.75, "description": "Standardisation is a powerful tool to achieve better interoperability.

In 2000 41 significant attacks on aid workers were recorded across the globe. By 2014, that number had risen to 190. In this 15-year period, over 3,000 aid workers have been killed, injured or kidnapped. Despite the increasing availability of tracking and monitoring technologies, the number of humanitarian workers that fall victim to attacks continues to rise. Clearly, a novel and innovative approach to tracking and decision-making is needed.  Information systems for fleet management, GPS for navigation and location or RFID tags for inventory management are just a few of the technologies that have changed the humanitarian operations. Until now, however, there is no integrated decision support system that provides real-time analyses from the data streams that are generated by these technologies. This lack of integrated real-time information prevents an understanding of potentially threatening situations, increases response times and creates insecure communications, all leading to inadequate protection and hampered efficiency and effectiveness. The aim of better protection and more efficient and effective operations can only be achieved by devel-oping technologies along with the policies for their use. GPS, for example, notwithstanding its capability to provide live tracking of vehicles for recovery, cannot prevent an ambush or kidnapping. Technologies therefore need to go hand in hand with procedures and policies in order to provide useful early warnings to decision-makers on the ground as well as decision support for scheduling, navigation, risk management and coordination. Policies, in other words, provide for the essential guidance on how to use the technologies in the field.

If making existing infrastructure “smarter” is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover? These are the main questions tackled by this proposal.

Earthquake Induced Liquefaction Disasters (EILDs) is responsible for tremendous amounts of the structural damages and fatalities; with experiences from recent events giving example of where approx. half of the economic loss was directly caused by liquefaction. Liquefaction is a phenomenon, with previously a low profile until recent earthquake events, in which the stiffness and strength of soil is reduced by seismic activity. With the causes of Liquefaction being known, it is important to recognize the factors that contribute to its occurrence; as well as the resulting hazards. The theory on how to address the subject has been comprehensive, as well as the engineering to reduce its consequences of liquefaction already developed; however, recent findings and advances need to be accurately examined in order to implement mitigation strategies practically. A systematic approach is needed for assessing the possibility of liquefaction on a site, prior to construction, then implementing the most appropriate liquefaction mitigation techniques. However, the variability of circumstances, invariably translates to multiple approaches of implementation, based on the susceptibility of the location to liquefaction, as well as the type and size of structure. The LIQUEFACT project addresses the mitigation of risks to EILD events in European communities with a holistic approach. The project not only deals with the resistance of structures to EILD events, but also, the resilience of the collective urban community in relation to their quick recovery from an occurrence. The LIQUEFACT project sets out to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of EILDs, the applications of the mitigation techniques, and the development of more appropriate techniques tailored to each specific scenario, for both Europe and global.", "startDate": "2016-05-01", "endDate": "2019-10-31", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "700748", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"topicName\":\"Demonstration activity on tools for adapting building and infrastructure standards and design methodologies in vulnerable locations in case of natural or man-originated catastrophes\",\"euroscivoc\":\"\",\"topicCode\":\"DRS-13-2015\",\"workProgram\":\"2014-15\",\"callName\":\"Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change\",\"callId\":\"\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700748", "beneficiaries": 12.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": null, "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "topicName": "Demonstration activity on tools for adapting building and infrastructure standards and design methodologies in vulnerable locations in case of natural or man-originated catastrophes", "topicCode": "DRS-13-2015"}, {"id": 458.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-710770", "name": "PROTECT-2 - PeRsonnel lOcation and Tracking for safEty of Critical InfrasTructures", "amount": 50000.0, "description": "A key enabling element to boost the Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management for the Critical Infrastructures (CI), including Urban Soft Targets, comes from the capability of pinpointing the location of the personnel operating in the frame of the Critical Infrastructure Protection.

During the last 2 years, the company’s founders have been developing innovative UAV platforms, software applications, payloads, and material technologies. AERDRON has been actively developing an aerial monitoring solution called EXTREMDRON. The EXTREMDRON series of UAVs addresses many of the limitations of products currently available in terms of environmental limitations, material performance, security applications, operating envelope, and flight performance. The EXTREMDRON can operate in extreme environments which would keep other UAVs grounded during security/public safety critical events.   Our last project, ED1 EXTREMDRON was another step in AERDRON strategic roadmap for developing high tech, and industrialized UAVs for professional sensing applications. The ED1 is equipped with a proprietary developed software that configures sensors, cameras, and encrypts communications thru an onboard computer. The ED1 was fully designed, engineered, and manufactured in house per our company’s commitment to home grown innovation.  AERDRON recognizes that Europe/world faces increasing security threats against its civilians, and critical/soft infrastructure targets. The frequency of attacks against civilian soft targets in Europe is alarming, and new technologies must be developed in the coming years to create a counterforce multiplier. There is a real need for aerial monitoring/sensing solutions focused on the protection of heavily populated areas, and critical/soft infrastructures. AERDRON proposal EXTREMDRON focuses on a creating a NexGen UAV for aerial monitoring applications in extreme operating environments (fires, radiation/nuclear, hazardous chemicals). This niche UAV application has not been successfully realized by any products currently on the market, and there is a real world need for these capabilities to save lives, and critical infrastructures. The EXTREMDRON provides a means to monitor and collect data in extreme environments for security agencies to analyze, collect data, identify threats, and means to rapidly respond to life critical situations which ground crews cannot enter an area for safety reasons. The EXTREMDRON also provides industries/government agencies the means to measure dangerous airborne substances at the disaster location, and its dissipation over populated areas. The EXTREMDRON will be a valuable tool in protecting public safety, and critical infrastructures.   AERDRON plans to carry out a small-scale demonstration of our innovative prototype EXTREMDRON with the aim of adjusting the physical scale of the UAV (ED2). Some of the activities include: test and adapt new raw materials, perform product design, define the production process and demonstrate and validate its efficacy in small scale actions.

Plans for water management (scarcity of water resources), next generation emergency services (fire brigades), rainwater drainage challenges (enlarging urban environments) or strategic use of sensor systems to detect gas, drugs or explosives are essential and complex tasks.  As Europe is urging to solve the issues mentioned above (Groundwater directive, Urban Drainage, Water Framework directive), local governments are looking into this matter.

Whereas demand and applications for drones are fast-growing, the drone market is also raising security and privacy issues. Presently, there are obvious concerns about the possibility of using drones for terrorist attacks in which drones could be equipped with explosives and biological weapons. The development of new and efficient tools able to detect and jam civilian drones used for illegal proposes has become a priority in the security field. MyDefence aims to pursue a major market opportunity through the development of an innovative drone alarm and protection system (DAPS) to be used by security services providers and critical infrastructure owners - public and private sectors - in urban contexts. DAPS is a scalable, networked system with hardware and embedded software algorithms coupled to a graphical user interface. DAPS is able to detect and identify illegal drones around secure areas and to jam the device in a specific wireless frequency range without interfering with other mobile signals and forcing a controlled drone landing. Whereas the core technology is already demonstrated in an operational environment, the further maturation of the concept into a fully commercial and scalable solution is hampered due to the existence of technical and non-technical barriers. Therefore, there is a need to further establish market and regulatory feasibility of the proposed DAPS concept. Also, demonstrate and validate both the technical and economic viability of DAPS at the level of different security applications. Initially, this will require a Phase 1 feasibility study that will give us a clear direction for our demonstration and market replication strategies.

Governments and businesses have invested billions into IP based communication from network infrastructure to smartphone PTT apps, yet innovation for the usability lag behind. Even though smartphones can run versatile applications, in practice they are little useful for public safety officials, because their job requires them to stay hands free.  You cannot chase a criminal and operate a touch screen phone simultaneously. Remote-Speaker-Microphones are indispensable. For this reason many public safety authorities continue using Walkie-Talkie Radios for PTT - despite the high costs - and use a smartphone for anything else.  Paumax recently launched a Bluetooth Speaker-Microphone, solving the immediate demand from public safety. Designed as a remote control of public safety smartphone apps, it features multiple buttons for PTT, Emergency, and programmable buttons to assign tasks of an app to the remote device.  In continuation Paumax plans to further develop and commercialise a market-disrupting device that combines the resilience of a Tetra Radio with the versatility of smart technology: The IP Communicator. This handheld device will run any PTT app directly loaded onto the speaker-microphone and connects directly to a wireless network.

Cyber attacks are made mostly against governments and corporates to gather guarded information, or to disrupt their operation in general. Advanced attackers targeted 5 out of 6 large companies each month in 2014, whereas 60% of all targeted attacks struck small- and medium-sized organisations. The same year companies across all industries worldwide have reported a total of 42.8 million detected attacks. And the consequences are varied and serious: crime involving computers and networks has cost the world economy more than $445 billion annually and the cost is expected to reach 1 trillion in 2016. Restroring damages caused by successful cyber attacks is extremely difficult and costly, if not impossible. Moreover, when a security breach occurs, the company or organisation concerned not only loses valuable and/or sensitive data, but it also suffers damage to its brand and reputation that can take a lot of time and money to repair. The increasing cybercrime urges for innovative cyber security solutions that are able to detect and immediately respond to attacks that are highly sophisticated and damaging, which is more important than ever. And this phenomena generates market opportunity for cybersecurity specialty companies. At ReaQta we develop the next generation cyber security protection solution –ReaQta-core - that can revolutionise the IT security market by offering a higher level of protection to governments and private organisations.

All underground infrastructure is only accessible through one method – inspection chambers. These inspection chambers are common and 100s can exist within a small area. To prevent criminal damage to infrastructure and ensure safety, all of these chambers are covered with access covers. There have been no major innovations of access covers in recent times and most remain completely unsecure and vulnerable. Requests to increase security has resulted in simple measures taken in the form of padlocks and key-locks, which still leave significant vulnerabilities. Alongside these vulnerabilities, covers in strategic sites need daily monitoring. This is currently done manually with physical inspections. There is a significant cost incurred for this.  We are Hugslock Systems and have developed a solution that will secure all underground infrastructure.

Whilst cryptography can guarantee many security properties, it crucially depends on the ability to keep the used keys secret even in face of determined adversaries.  Over the last two decades a new type of adversary has emerged, able to obtain, from the cryptographic implementation, side channel leakage such as recording of response times, power or EM signals, etc. To account for such adversaries, sophisticated security certification and evaluation methods (Common Criteria, EMVCo, FIPS…) have been established to give users assurance that security claims have withstood independent evaluation and testing. Recently the reliability of these evaluations has come into the spotlight: the Taiwanese citizen card proved to be insecure, and Snowden’s revelations about NSA's tampering with FIPS standards eroded public confidence. REASSURE will (1) improve the efficiency and quality of all aspects of certification using a novel, structured detect-map-exploit approach that will also improve the comparability of independently conducted evaluations, (2) cater for emerging areas such as the IoT by automating leakage assessment practices in order to allow resistance assessment without immediate access to a testing lab, (3) deliver tools to stakeholders, such as reference data sets and an open-source leakage simulator based on instruction-level profiles for a processor relevant for the IoT, (4) improve existing standards by actively pushing the novel results to standardization bodies.

Concerns about banking security have always existed, but it has been after the breakthrough of online and mobile banking when bank fraud has become major issue to address with urgency. Currently, banking authentication is typically done by using 4-6 digits PIN codes. This form of authentication provides an extremely low security, especially in online banking where cybercriminals can hack this PIN code in a matter of seconds. As a result, the total value of fraudulent transactions is rapidly increasing year by year, being now estimated at €1.44 billion solely in Europe.

Cyber-attacks can harm intangible assets like reputation, IPR, expertise, and know-how. And there is severe imbalance between the efficiency of attacks and inadequate defences, due in part to the lack of quantitative information for decision makers to prioritise security investments.  To foster a culture of risk management by an individual organisation or a complete sector, HERMENEUT answers: What is the real fallout of a data compromise and the long-run consequences on associated assets? What are the losses for intangible assets? Do other type of attacks (beyond data breach) severely impact intangible and tangible assets?   HERMENEUT assesses vulnerabilities of organisations and corresponding tangible and intangible assets at risk, taking into account the business plans of the attacker, the commoditisation level of the target organisations, the exposure of the target and including human factors as well as estimating the likelihood that a potential cyber-attack exploits identified vulnerabilities. HERMENEUT’s cyber-security cost-benefit approach combines integrated assessment of vulnerabilities and their likelihoods with an innovative macro- and micro-economic model for intangible costs, delivering a quantitative estimation of the risks for an organisation or a business sector and investment guidelines for mitigation measures. 11 partners from 6 countries deliver an innovative methodology and advanced macro- and micro-economic models and make it available to the European research community.

Taking into account this fact and this real threat on EU ports as one of the main CI in Europe, SAURON project proposes the holistic situation awareness concept as an integrated, scalable and yet installation-specific solution for protecting EU ports and its surroundings. This solution combines the more advanced physical SA features with the newest techniques in prevention, detection and mitigation of cyber-threats, including the synthetic cyber space understanding through the use of new visualization techniques (immersive interfaces, cyber 3D models and so on). In addition, a Hybrid Situation Awareness (HSA) application capable of determine the potential consequences of any threat will show the potential cascading effect of a detected threat in the two different domains (physical and cyber). On the other hand, through SAURON approach the public in the surroundings and the rescue/security teams will be able to be informed on any potential event/situation that could put in risk their integrity.

Reaching beyond the technology focused boundaries of classical information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity includes organizational and behavioural aspects of IT systems and also needs to comply to the currently actively developing legal and regulatory framework for cybersecurity. For example, the European Union recently passed the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive that obliges member states to get in line with the EU strategy. While large corporations might have the resources to follow those developments and bring their IT infrastructure and services in line with the requirements, the burden for smaller organizations like local public administration will be substantial and the required resources might not be available. New and innovative solutions that will help local public administration to ease the burden of being in line with cybersecurity requirements are needed. For example, cooperation and coordination is one of the major aspects of the NIS and EU cybersecurity strategy. An enabling technology for cooperation and coordination is cyber situational awareness and information sharing of cyber incidents. In this project we propose a cybersecurity situational awareness solution for local public administrations that, based on an analysis of the context provides automatic incident detection and visualization, and enables information exchange with relevant national and EU level NIS authorities like CERTs.

Recommended procedures for explosive detection are inherently unsafe: due to current technological limitations, EU regulations only prescribe screenings on a variable percentage of randomly chosen passengers. Being not portable, such devices can only be installed at screening lines - but in Brussels 2016 explosions happened way before them. Moreover, existing devices just allow to analyse swabbed points instead of the passengers’ total body. In the meantime, those procedures are slow (up to 30 s/passenger) and intrusive, requiring physical contact (swabbing): two major drawbacks, considering that airports competition is based today on passenger experience.  Eye on Air developed I-MUST, a handheld disruptive device based on a proprietary, ultra-thin and high sensitive Ion Mobility Spectrometry sensor. Embedded into I-MUST, it ensures the most secure detection of explosives, with a sensitivity 500 times higher than its competitors (0.1 ppb) and the detection of >150 compounds, i.e. 3 to 5 times more compounds than currently used technology. I-MUST can be used not only at screening lines, but everywhere in public places, allowing to introduce the concept of a “distributed security” and, thanks to the brief time of analysis (2 s), 100% passengers can be scanned. By using short ion beams and a small, annular drift space, Eye on Air obtained such performing, enabling technology, whose features have already been confirmed in October 2015 by TNO, the Dutch research institute devoted to the certification of airport screening devices.  During Phase 1 project, Eye on Air will assess the scale-up industrialization plan and will evaluate a sound go-to-market strategy to ensure successful commercialization of the I-MUST device for airport explosive detection.", "startDate": "2016-12-01", "endDate": "2017-03-31", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "744926", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"topicName\":\"Engaging SMEs in security research and development\",\"euroscivoc\":\"\",\"topicCode\":\"SMEInst-13-2016-2017\",\"callName\":\"SME Instrument\",\"workProgram\":\"2016-17\",\"callId\":\"\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/744926", "beneficiaries": 1.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": null, "callId": null, "callName": "SME Instrument", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2016-17", "topicName": "Engaging SMEs in security research and development", "topicCode": "SMEInst-13-2016-2017"}, {"id": 545.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-745088", "name": "NK-52-2016 - Next generation authentication for the digital age", "amount": 50000.0, "description": "The cost of cybercrime is rocketing—to $500 billion in 2015 according to The Economist.

As such, the card only works with the rightful owner’s fingerprint and will improve drastically the security of online and physical transactions.   The card will be marketable in two generations/versions: • 1st generation QuardCard for the generation of OTPs through user’s fingerprint for e-banking authentication and e-commerce transactions; • 2nd generation QuardCard combining generation of OTPs with capacity for physical transactions (card payments or cash withdrawal), replacing the need for a conventional credit card. Due to the certification compliance of the current prototype, both generations will be ready for mass production upon completion of the QuardCard project.

Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. €1.44 billion annually and €14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to €13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user’s mobile device to determine his/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data.

Recruitment of this new breed of terrorists was done via social media and the Internet.   To prevent such events from happening in the future and fight radicalization, it is crucial to detect cyberpropaganda early. However, social media providers (e.g. Twitter) admit that at the moment there is no adequate tool to identify terrorist-related content on the Internet. As the result, they are forced to rely on proprietary spam-fighting tools, user reports and human analysis to track down radicalized accounts that promote terrorism.   Insikt Intelligence is a Spanish SME led by the EYIF 2016 Female Web Entrepreneur finalist that developed INSIKT, a novel social data mining platform to detect & defeat violent online radicalization. An early version of INSIKT was validated by several EU law enforcement agencies (LEAs), approved and attracted commercial interest. This Phase 2 project will trial INSIKT at 4 European LEAs that are looking for effective tools to prevent radical messages from spreading and reaching people vulnerable to radicalization.   INSIKT provides a novel solution for LEA analysts to detect terrorist propaganda on all social media: it identifies radical content, suspicious messages and covert radicalization process with the help of sophisticated text mining algorithms. INSIKT relies on deep learning to develop automatically new models which can be used to detect other criminal activity as well. INSIKT is fit to become an important new tool in LEAs’ investigation and evidence gathering arsenal, giving them highly accurate, multilingual and real-time detection capabilities.

KNOX detects and identifies civilian drones and protects infrastructures and mobile soft targets against drones’ threats. Drones are quickly moving from being mainly a military technology to a mass market gadget. Whereas demand and applications for drones are fast-growing, the drone market also raises security and privacy concerns. Presently, there are obvious concerns about the possibility of using drones for illicit purposes and terrorist attacks in which drones could be equipped with explosives, biological or chemical weapons.   MyDefence has developed an innovative drone alarm able to detect, identify and locate civilian drones around secure areas, and to jam in a specific wireless frequency range without interfering with other mobile signals and forcing a controlled drone landing. KNOX is also an early warning of drones’ activity and helps to locate the pilot before the accident/attack takes place. KNOX is expected to be a game changing solution for drone detection and protection in urban contexts.  The present innovation project will focus on demonstrating the full KNOX solution including tactical operating procedures in 2 prisons and in 2 sports stadiums in Denmark and UK. This will be the first step towards showcasing the full concept and validating the solution under real operational environments, thus representing a key milestone for overcoming prevailing market entrance barriers for MyDefence.

The algorithm design will be accompanied with implementation and performance evaluation, as well as formal security analysis in the full range of TPM environments: i.e. hardware, software and virtualization environments. Use cases in online banking, activity tracking and device management will provide environments and applications to validate the FutureTPM framework.  Security, privacy and trust in a computing system are usually achieved using tamper-resistant devices to provide core cryptographic and security functions. The TPM is one such device and provides the system with a root-of-trust and a cryptographic engine. However, to sustain this enhanced system security it is crucial that the crypto functions in the TPM are not merely secure for today but will also remain secure in the long-term against quantum attacks.  FutureTPM will address this challenge by providing robust and provably-secure QR algorithms for a new generation of TPMs. Research on quantum computers has drawn enormous attention from governments and industry; if, as predicted, a large-scale quantum computer becomes a reality within the next 15 years, existing public-key algorithms will be open to attack. Any significant change to a TPM takes time and requires theoretical and practical research before adoption. Therefore, to ensure a smooth transition to QR cryptography we should start now. A key strategic objective of FutureTPM is to contribute to standardization efforts at EU level within TCG, ISO/IEC and ETSI.

Because ultrasound waves easily travel inside matter, a fingerprint sensor based on ultrasound provides significantly more secure authentication as it is able to capture 3D features. Ultrasound sensor is as convenient to use as other competing fingerprint sensors. Thus far, full benefits of ultrasound technology have not yet been used to meet the all end-user needs. MODULEUS will exploit technological advantages of ultrasound to address end-user needs related to high security confidence, usage convenience and privacy safeguard.

Supply-chain security is flawed and unchanged in 30 years. If you transport or store goods, it is difficult to know that your goods were treated correctly. For decades the supply chain industry has depended on bolt/cable seals, documentation and locks, knowing that these provide extremely limited safeguards and evidence trails. As a result theft, people trafficking and narcotics smuggling are rampant. An estimated 8% of medicine sold worldwide is counterfeit (Source: WHO 2015). Improper storage is detected too late to prevent waste. In addition, inspection delays are a major cost in the total supply chain.  Babbler uses IoT and an inverted evidence principle to provide much better assurance of cargo security problems.In 2015 we were selected for an accelerator in the EU FIWARE program and in that accelerator won a cash prize for best startup in 2016. The accelerator provided funding so we could create and test a solution for shipping containers with business partners (Royal FloraHolland, Dutch Customs Organisation, Seatrade and others).  Although Babbler proved its value in those trials and is attracting international interest, the shipping industry is conservative and slow-moving. To use Babbler a number of links in the supply chain have to decide to work together, which makes the buying process slow. We concluded that we can grow faster by focussing on niches in the supply chain, rather than an entire chain itself.  We have identified several candidate market segments but need funds to test our assumptions and determine if Babbler needs to be tweaked accordingly. We are considering: 1. Transport and storage of medical supplies, 2. TAPA level 2 certified road carriers, 3. Road carriers that EU cross borders with people trafficking issues.

Know-your-customer (KYC) is a legal obligation for online onboarding into financial services: to ensure that the person claiming a particular identity is in fact this person. To this end, the EU adopted eIDAS Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. Nevertheless, eIDAS provides a regulatory environment with three assurance levels (low, substantial and high) but it is up to the Member States to define both the tools needed for each assurance level and the associated financial services allowed per level.

Computer systems assist core functions of hospitals, energy centers, logistics, and communications, to name a few, and compromising such systems may have severe consequences for everyone of us. Despite the evolution of computer systems, current security defenses-although they have been substantially improved in the last decade-seem not really enough to stop advanced cyber attacks. Systems still suffer from vulnerabilities, despite the many active or passive defenses in place that have been developed in the last decades.  We believe that the core of this problem is that cyber attackers are almost always one step ahead of the cyber security researchers and practitioners. Indeed, cyber attackers are the first to strike, and while researchers try to figure out what happened, attackers have all the time in the world to plan their next strike. In this project we advocate that we should change the rules of the cyber attackers’ game and challenge the asymmetry. Instead of following the cyber attackers, researchers should try to forecast where attackers will strike next and to use this information (i) to fortify potential targets to withstand the attack and (ii) to wire targets up with forensic hooks and make them “forensics ready”.

Indeed, if users are strongly identified during a transaction, then privacy is non-existent. Nevertheless, there exist mechanisms that can reconcile privacy and strong identity, either by trusting an online identity provider (IDP), or by using cryptographic mechanisms such as anonymous credentials.   The former approach, made popular by technologies such as SAML, OpenID Connect, and Facebook Connect, has the disadvantage that the IDP forms a single point of failure in terms of privacy and security, because it can impersonate and track its users online. The latter approach has the disadvantage that users have to rely on trusted hardware such as smartcards to protect credentials from compromise and from illegitimate sharing.   OLYMPUS will take a radically new approach offering the seamless user experience of online IDPs, but without their drawbacks. Namely, OLYMPUS will pioneer the concept of distributed oblivious identity management, where the role of the IDP is split over multiple authorities, so that no single authority can track or impersonate their users. By exploiting advanced techniques based on threshold cryptography, the OLYMPUS framework will let users maintain unlinkable identities with different service providers while using standard devices and a single password or biometric.   By leveraging existing eID solutions to create a strong link to physical identities, and by integrating into existing frameworks to ease adoption by service providers, OLYMPUS will establish a secure and interoperable European identity management framework.

Since these tasks may be performed obliviously on protected data (i.e. encrypted data), the PAPAYA will design and develop dedicated privacy preserving data analytics primitives that will enable data owners to extract valuable information from this protected data, while being cost-effective and accurate.  The PAPAYA project will consider compliance with the GDPR as a key enabler to provide solutions that minimize the privacy risks while increasing trust in third-party data processors by means of auditing and visualization modules (a dashboard). The PAPAYA primitives as well as the dashboard will be combined in an integrated platform that will be designed, implemented and validated through a set of use cases reflecting relevant real world applications (namely, healthcare analytics and web & mobile data analytics).", "startDate": "2018-05-01", "endDate": "2021-04-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "786767", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[],\"workProgram\":\"2014-15\",\"topicName\":\"Cybersecurity PPP: Privacy, Data Protection, Digital Identities\",\"topicCode\":\"DS-08-2017\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/social sciences/economics and business\",\"callId\":\"\",\"callName\":\"Digital Security Focus Area\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786767", "beneficiaries": 6.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": "/social sciences/economics and business", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security Focus Area", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "topicName": "Cybersecurity PPP: Privacy, Data Protection, Digital Identities", "topicCode": "DS-08-2017"}, {"id": 607.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-786773", "name": "PEN-CP - Pan-European Network of Customs Practitioners", "amount": 3496253.13, "description": "Pan-European Network of Customs Practitioners (PEN-CP) project builds a network between distinct customs administrations to create an ecosystem for interoperability, knowledge sharing and innovation to improve European security though more efficient control of the illicit trade flows.

Unfortunately, this often results in security being managed by people without enough skills or specific expertise, it may not be able to cope with threats coming from the virtualization layer itself (e.g., hypervisor bugs), and also exposes security appliances to the same threats as the other application components.

The sources of these threats have been heterogeneous, as well as weapons to impact the population. As Europeans, we know now that we must increase our awareness against these attacks that can strike the places we rely upon the most and destabilize our institutions remotely. Today, the lines between physical and cyber worlds are increasingly blurred. Nearly everything is connected to the Internet and if not, physical intrusion might rub out the barriers. Threats cannot be analysed solely as physical or cyber, and therefore it is critical to develop an integrated approach in order to fight against such combination of threats. Health services are at the same time among the most critical infrastructures and the most vulnerable ones. They are widely relying on information systems to optimize organization and costs, whereas ethics and privacy constraints severely restrict security controls and thus increase vulnerability. The aim of this proposal is to provide solutions that will improve physical and cyber security in a seamless and cost-effective way. It will promote new technologies and novel approaches to enhance threat prevention, threat detection, incident response and mitigation of impacts.

Radio Physics Solutions Ltd has developed MiRTLE (Millimetre-wave Radar Threat Level Evaluation), the world’s first, high performance, long range (up to 50m), low cost, standoff “concealed threat” detection system for the protection of citizens and critical infrastructure. MiRTLE is capable of screening large groups of people automatically and autonomously, without operator intervention, in real-time. Our highly innovative system detects PBIEDs, guns (including 3D printed) and knives up to a range of 50m in real-time, with targets in motion, all without privacy concerns.   The overall objective of this project is to successfully refine, scale-up and demonstrate our superior technology to our customer base. We are planning to capture an 8% market share of the improvised explosive devices (IED) and weapon detection market, which will in turn generate cumulative revenues of €161m, cumulative EBITDA of €43m by 2025 and create 302 high skilled jobs in Europe.", "startDate": "2018-10-01", "endDate": "2020-07-31", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "806097", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"critical infrastructure\"],\"topicName\":\"Engaging SMEs in security research and development\",\"topicCode\":\"SMEInst-13-2016-2017\",\"callName\":\"SME Instrument\",\"callId\":\"\",\"euroscivoc\":\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\",\"workProgram\":\"2016-17\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/806097", "beneficiaries": 2.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"critical infrastructure\"]", "euroscivoc": "/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce", "callId": null, "callName": "SME Instrument", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2016-17", "topicName": "Engaging SMEs in security research and development", "topicCode": "SMEInst-13-2016-2017"}, {"id": 640.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-806911", "name": "Quakebots - Artificial Intelligence and IoT for seismic monitoring", "amount": 50000.0, "description": "The objective of the Quakebots project is to introduce and validate a novel technology and tools for disaster management during earthquakes, with the ambition of minimizing both direct and indirect damage during and after a seismic event, increasing people safety and helping in the assessment of post-seismic damage to critical infrastructures. Recent news of disasters in central Italy, and southern Europe in general, demonstrated how earthquakes are one of the most harmful natural disasters, accountable for invaluable losses in terms of damage to critical infrastructures, cultural heritage and impairment of local transportation and energy distribution network. Unfortunately, the countries that are more exposed to seismic risk show also the highest percentage of building heritage older than 40 years, more than 75%, and ancient historical buildings, with no seismic aware design in place. In such countries, earthquakes are also accountable for countless death tolls. Quake Engineering proposes a distributed sensor network that is capable of automatically detect the occurrence of primary waves during a seismic event, and acting as a distributed IoT P2P neural network, propagate an alert to all the other nodes in the network in cascade. This “signaling” wave propagates much faster than the harmful secondary waves, providing the users with a local acoustic and visual alert, giving them a small time frame in the magnitude of tens of seconds for taking safety critical actions. The main purpose of the project is to carry an extensive demonstration of the effectiveness of the solution in a medium scale scenario, targeting the B2B and B2A markets as the most promising and eager early adopters. The project will also cover the incremental research and development effort for a rapid market uptake. It is foreseen that the system will be ready for the commercialization by 2019.

Web application attacks are the most common attack pattern, with 40% of all breaches. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities that were introduced in the applications inadvertently by their developers. The most popular solution companies use to find vulnerabilities is to hire penetration testing services. However, these services are a) costly because they are performed manually and b) to manage all of the findings is very time consuming.   Due to these two reasons, companies don’t test the security of their applications as frequently as they should. Probe.ly automates web vulnerability scanning. Our customers can cost effectively scan web applications and efficiently manage the lifecycle of the vulnerabilities found in an intuitive web interface. As opposed to Web Application Penetration testing, Probe.ly, since it is automated, can offer a very competitive price and address a new market of small companies that do not have the budget for penetration testing services. The objective of our proposal is to enhance R&D to create a viable solution that helps companies to identify vulnerabilities in their web applications, contributing to safer applications and a safer Internet. We believe that, as opposed to the majority of our competitors, targeting  Developers is the right way, since they are the ones that introduced the vulnerabilities, but also because we can take a more educational role by explaining to them why the vulnerability exists, its impact and how to avoid future problems.

Only in 2015, the number of deaths almost reached the 45,000 people in over 3.5 million of fires attended. Infrastructures and vehicles fires account for over a 50% of the total. The economic cost of fire is also relevant. Only in the US, the total cost of fire in 2011 was estimated at $329 billion, or roughly 2.1 percent of U.S. GDP. This cost represents a 34% increase over 1980. Prevention measures for fires are based on devices like CO2 or temperature detectors, alarms and mechanical items like extinguishers, firefighting fixtures or pumping groups. These mechanical components are subject to visual inspections from time to time which in the mid-term is a major danger. These old-fashioned procedures for inspection and maintenance may cause major damages in the case of the fire, and have a high-cost in terms of money but also lives. A simple malfunction of the mechanical items can quickly turn fatal.

To face this fast-growing threat, and close the “digital gap” in investigations, law enforcement agencies established digital forensics units to find, extract and analyse digital data for fighting crimes, terrorism, espionage and improve cyber defence. Here, forensics experts are also confronted with damaged disks, deleted or compromised data.

This is important because 1) it makes the SIGA technology itself immune to cyber-attacks, as well as completely transparent to cyber-attacks on the SCADA system it is monitoring, and 2) it means that SIGAGuard effectively “insulates” the SCADA-controlled equipment from any outside interference (hacking) via the rest of the system, and can provide accurate early warning when an anomaly is detected, reducing unexpected equipment damage and increasing operational safety, efficiency, and reliability. SIGAGuard has successfully been tested with 2 large Israeli operators (Hagihon Water Company and Israel Electric Corporation) and is ready to be rolled out into the critical infrastructure protection market, estimated to grow from €90Bn in 2016 to €130 Bn by 2021 (source: Market and Markets).  SIGAGuard is sold as a package of hardware and software (one-time fee depending on size/complexity, average €250k per customer) plus a 15% annual fee for service & maintenance. Unlike competing solutions that can be deceived by advanced malware able to feed fake operational parameters to supervisory systems, SIGAGuard is deployed at the lowest tier of the infrastructure (end point), providing direct feedback on the physical parameters (electric signals) of the industrial components to be monitored.

ASSISTANCE project will use novel technologies such as; UAV, Robots, drones’ swarms and advanced training based on VR, MR and AR for increasing the FR’s situation awareness (SA) taking into account their need in terms of data (e.g. real time video, persons and objects location, evacuation routes status, ad-hoc network coverage and so on). Different types of adapted SA modules will be developed inside a common SA framework capable of offering the sensor outcome needed by each FR organization (e.g. real time video and resources location for firemen, evacuation routes status for emergency health services and so on). Regarding training, an advanced training network based on VR, MR, AR and other novel technologies and methodologies (e.g. tailored curricula, immersive interfaces, adapted training methodology definition, etc.) will be established in order to share different VR platforms and scenarios for enhancing the current training capabilities and skills of different FRs organization. All the ASSISTANCE results will be tested under controlled conditions in three different demostration pilots. Solutions will be developed in compliance with EU societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of privacy and personal data protection.

Criminal behaviours like financial frauds, intellectual property theft, industrial espionage, and terrorist networks leverage the Internet and cyberspace. The very ubiquity of digital devices, e.g. smartphones, in modern society makes digital evidence extremely relevant for investigations about all kinds of criminal behaviour like murder, contraband activities, and people smuggling, to name a few. Due to its nature, the use of digital evidence in a court of law has always been challenging. It is critical that it should be accompanied by a proper chain of custody, guaranteeing its source and integrity. LOCARD aims to provide a holistic platform for chain of custody assurance along the forensic workflow, a trusted distributed platform allowing the storage of digital evidence metadata in a blockchain. Each node of LOCARD will be able to independently set its own permission policies and to selectively share access to digital evidence with other nodes when deemed necessary and upon proper authorization through fine-grained policies. LOCARD's modularity will also allow diverse actors to tailor the platform to their specific needs and role in the digital forensic workflow, from preparation and readiness, to collection, to analysis and reporting. LOCARD will have a crowdsource module to collect citizen reports of selected violations, a crawler to detect and correlate online deviant behaviour, and a toolkit for investigators that will assist them in collecting online and offline evidence. This will be powered by an immutable storage and an identity management system that will protect privacy and handle access to evidence data using a Trusted Execution Environment.

Criminal offenders use phones to communicate, coordinate, organise and execute criminal actions. This is especially true for organised crime and terrorist organisations. This development provides new challenges for criminal prosecution and it is vital to empower law enforcement to access the data stored on mobile devices to use it as court evidence in a trustworthy and reliable manner. The overarching objective of FORMOBILE is to establish a complete end to end forensic investigation chain, targeting for mobile devices. To achieve this goal three objectives will be pursued. Novel tools shall be developed that include the acquisition of previously unavailable mobile data, unlocking mobile devices, as well as the decoding and analysis of mobile data. Based on the definition of requirements of law enforcement and legal and ethical issues a new mobile forensics standard shall be developed. With the developments of the new standard and the new tools, training for police and criminal prosecution will be established, providing the end users with the latest knowledge in a novel and an innovative curriculum to ensure a quality standard of investigations. The European Union has developed as a Security Union, building on the European Agenda on Security. This aims to ensure that people live in an area of freedom, security and justice, without internal frontiers. To strengthen digital forensics in the context of criminal investigations is crucial to achieve this vision. FORMOBILE contributes to the fight against virtually all forms of crime.

Within this context, authorities in charge of border and maritime patrol are faced with different challenges that include the heterogeneity of the traffic that undertakes illegal activities in European waters, limitations in the ability to collect and share timely available data among institutional organizations, as well as a lack of assets by the relevant authorities to cover the wide maritime areas under their mandate. Although there has been an expressive investment done in the domain of surveillance technologies and tools, the intake by the competent authorities has been slow, due to lack of uniformity in the integration of such systems with existing surveillance infrastructures. In order to address these challenges, project COMPASS2020 aims to demonstrate the combined use and seamless coordination of manned and unmanned assets to achieve greater coverage, better quality of information and shorter response times in maritime surveillance operations.

SOTER main results will be: SOTER Digital Onboarding Platform (the technology tool to provide a robust and sovereign digital identity, facilitating the interconnections between different services providers and the users), improved by the use of blockSOTER will offer tools that are able to determine the level of cyber security that exists in a certain entity, to improve if that is the case. We intend to get this through a comprehensive risk analysis to create contingency plans and direct action measures that can mitigate threats and security attacks.  In the case of the finance sector, we propose to test and analyze a cloud platform of Digital Onboarding with two main features:  •\tuse of technologies blockchain •\tinnovative systems of biometric identification of users  Derived from this, training actions for end users will be generated so they are able to detect and deal with this type of threats.", "startDate": "2019-07-01", "endDate": "2021-10-31", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "833923", "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"biometric\"],\"euroscivoc\":\"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security\",\"topicName\":\"Digital security, privacy, data protection and accountability in critical sectors\",\"workProgram\":\"2018-20\",\"topicCode\":\"SU-DS05-2018-2019\",\"callName\":\"Security\",\"callId\":\"\",\"theme\":\"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\",\"callArea\":\"\"}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833923", "beneficiaries": 9.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"biometric\"]", "euroscivoc": "/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security", "callId": null, "callName": "Security", "callArea": null, "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2018-20", "topicName": "Digital security, privacy, data protection and accountability in critical sectors", "topicCode": "SU-DS05-2018-2019"}, {"id": 772.0, "foreign_id": "eu-project-833955", "name": "SDN-microSENSE - SDN - microgrid reSilient Electrical eNergy SystEm", "amount": 7992462.5, "description": "The smart energy ecosystem constitutes the next technological leap of the conventional electrical grid, providing multiple benefits such as increased reliability, better service quality and efficient utilization of the existing infrastructures. However, despite the fact that it brings beneficial environmental, economic and social changes, it also generates significant security and privacy challenges, as it includes a combination of heterogeneous, co-existing smart and legacy technologies. Based on this reality, the SDN-microSENSE project intends to provide a set of secure, privacy-enabled and resilient to cyberattacks tools, thus ensuring the normal operation of EPES as well as the integrity and the confidentiality of communications. In particular, adopting an SDN-based technology, SDN-microSENSE will develop a three-layer security architecture, by deploying and implementing risk assessment processes, self-healing capabilities, large-scale distributed detection and prevention mechanisms, as well as an overlay privacy protection framework. Firstly, the risk assessment framework will identify the risk level of each component of EPES, identifying the possible threats and vulnerabilities. Accordingly, in the context of self-healing, islanding schemes and energy management processes will be deployed, isolating the critical parts of the network in the case of emergency. Furthermore, collaborative intrusion detection tools will be capable of detecting and preventing possible threats and anomalies timely.

The aim of the platform is to permit a better overview of current and new projects being at, national, European or International level; ensuring more coordination between all stakeholders and responding more efficiently and timely to the critical needs following an agreed strategic vision and identified priorities. Besides ensuring the necessary partnering network, the project will review the necessary tools and mechanisms including the CEN and CENELEC Workshop Agreement (CWA) process and a fast-track procedure to adopt, if market relevant, a CWA or any other deliverable or reference document e.g. TS and TR into a consensus standard (EN).

On the other hand, Law enforcement has noted that more and more teenagers and young people are increasingly committing cybercrimes.   This is an international problem which has considerable cost implications; it is estimated that crimes in cyberspace will cost the global economy $445B annually. Understanding the behavioural and developmental aspects of cyber criminality is becoming increasingly important and underlies the necessity of a shift in focus from sanctions to deterrence and prevention.  As a research project, RAYUELA aims to bring together law enforcement agencies (LEAs), sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, legal experts, computer scientists and engineers, to develop novel methodologies that allow better understanding the factors affecting online behaviour related to new ways of cyber criminality, as well as promoting the potential of these young talents for cybersecurity and technologies.

It can be very problematic when investigations are underway and quick results are needed. Traces must be detected on-site as soon as possible before they degrade and loose forensic information important for criminal investigation. Based on the results of the FORLAB project, the aim of the RISEN project is the development of a set of real-time contactless sensors for the optimization of the trace, detection, visualisation, identification and interpretation on site, with a consequent reduction of the time and resources in the laboratory, and for a fast exchange of information among LEAs. The new proposed approach could be applied to the classical forensic investigations and to disaster sites, e.g. after a terrorist attack. The objectives of the RISEN project will be obtained by: -Developing and demonstrating contactless, non-destructive, automated sensors to identify, select and label trace materials; -Processing and sending in real-time acquired in-situ data to a 3D Augmented Crime Scene Investigation system to produce an interactive 3D model of the scene with position and labelling of traces and relative results of the on-site analysis.

Mobile phones are often a key factor in criminal cases, intrusions, intellectual property theft, security threats, and more. The data stored in these devices may contain critical evidence associated with the above-mentioned crimes.  The latest generation of devices incorporate new security features and encryption schemes to 'protect' the device and its associated user data. The other side of the coin is that the rapid processing of critical evidence by various information retrieval techniques is slowed down, if not made impossible. The mobile device forensics field is a challenging area for forensic analysts, particularly given the increasing number of data encryption mechanisms. The EXFILES project aims to provide law enforcement agencies (LEAs) with new tools to extract data and associated evidence from these devices in strict legal contexts. A unique consortium of five LEAs, universities and cyber security companies from the EU have joined forces to address these challenges. Together, they defined three areas of work on technical data extraction techniques, namely software exploitation, hardware methods and combined methods. In addition, tools and methods inspired by other areas of information security (e.g. security assessments based on common criteria) will lead to new judicial methods of accessing data for lawful investigations. Another unique dimension of EXFILES is the clear focus on the ethical and legal aspects of research and exploitation as well as dissemination and training activities for the next generation of forensic experts. The main objective of EXFILES project is to improve Law Enforcement Agencies techniques and methods, to extract digital evidence from modern encrypted smartphones used by criminals based on holistic approach (both software and hardware).

R&D assessment and recommendations on critical technologies key for the development of future European multifunction RF AESA systems, establishing roadmaps and priorities avoiding dependencies from non-EU suppliers. 2. R&T activities on system and component level. These activities will bebased on the requirements identified from the main stakeholders and on the architecture study fulfilled. Demonstrators for the different levels, system, and component, will be developed taking in consideration the inputs of the R&D assessment to avoid as much as possible non-European technologies for CROWN demonstrators. A broadband antenna, wideband digital beam former (DBF) (electronic scan with multibeam capability in transmission and reception in a HW platform) and an advanced SW resource manager (RSM) (key for the multifunction coordination of the system) will be produced for the system level. At component level research activities will be done for Transmit/Receive modules(TRMs). Highpower, bandwidth, frequency and tunability are key objectives for the TRMs. Two different open and trustable EU foundries, being one of them part of the consortium, will be used for TRM design,manufacturing and test. SwaP-C, packaging, cooling and ilities (reliability, manufacturability, etc) are also aspects that will be included at both levels. The objective for these activities is intended to target at least TRL 4. In addition, a small-scale prototype will be also designed, manufactured, and tested in a laboratory environment. Laboratory results will be conveniently scaled to the system level through modelling. System modelling will integrate models from the main building blocks studied (antenna, TRMs, DBF and RSM) to assess the performance of the defined system upon different scenarios.", "startDate": "2021-07-01", "endDate": null, "program": "PADR", "projectId": null, "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"military\"]}", "sourceUrl": null, "beneficiaries": 11.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"military\"]", "euroscivoc": null, "callId": null, "callName": null, "callArea": null, "theme": null, "workProgram": null, "topicName": null, "topicCode": null}, {"id": 1182.0, "foreign_id": "osd-project-cy-1760e02845895c5408945a847e653cd6b837961a", "name": "Maintenance and technical support for the hardware and software of the Visa Information System", "amount": 0.0, "description": null, "startDate": null, "endDate": null, "program": "Internal Security Fund", "projectId": null, "indexText": "{\"tags\":[]}", "sourceUrl": null, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": null, "callId": null, "callName": null, "callArea": null, "theme": null, "workProgram": null, "topicName": null, "topicCode": null}, {"id": 1183.0, "foreign_id": "osd-project-cy-19ba65f113c608a2a18f16eb53c6ec6f8d39aa31", "name": "Installation of Border Xpress Kiosks in Larnaca and Paphos Airports", "amount": 1641934.0, "description": null, "startDate": null, "endDate": null, "program": "Internal Security Fund", "projectId": null, "indexText": "{\"tags\":[]}", "sourceUrl": null, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "programs": true, "tags": null, "euroscivoc": null, "callId": null, "callName": null, "callArea": null, "theme": null, "workProgram": null, "topicName": null, "topicCode": null}, {"id": 1184.0, "foreign_id": "osd-project-cy-1a2d3e133d4c91e4a35cc58c7c77f2c30992226e", "name": "Training of Police members on Union acquis", "amount": 220803.06, "description": null, "startDate": null, "endDate": null, "program": "Internal Security Fund", "projectId": null, "indexText": "{\"tags\":[\"police\"]}", "sourceUrl": null, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "programs": true, "tags": "[\"police\"]", "euroscivoc": null, "callId": null, "callName": null, "callArea": null, "theme": null, "workProgram": null, "topicName": null, "topicCode": null}, {"id": 1185.0, "foreign_id": "osd-project-cy-2020-isf-so1-no1-2-1", "name": "Necessary actions/activities in preparation for the new National Visa Information System (CY-VIS)", "amount": 678044.02, "description": "This project co-finances the necessary preparatory actions for the implementation of the new National Visa Information System (CY-VIS) which will comply with the Schengen acquis.

The number of cases of documentary fraud in connection with other crimes is increasing, as the number of travelers continues to increase year after year. The LEICA DMV6 brand microscope has been designed for inspection, analysis and measurement in quality control, quality assurance, fault analysis, research, development and forensics.
