A promising forensic approach is 3D-reconstruction of evidence and its analysis but existing systems suffer from low accuracy, flexibility and resolution.\n\nA mobile high resolution 3D-scanning system and automatic 3D-data analysis software will be developed for use at crime scenes. The system will enhance state-of-the-art 3D-laser-scanning devices with much more detailed forensic evidence data acquisition (e.g. of foot prints or traces on bodies) and the software will relieve forensic experts of time-consuming data-processing by hand.

End-users, groups, SME, research bodies and governments will be involved to warrant the quality of work and the effectiveness of the dissemination activities.\nThe outcomes of ACRIMAS will be the definition and preparation of this method, documented in a roadmap (Phase I) that will prepare the actual demonstrations and experiments (Phase II). The final objective is to enable a gradual evolvement of CM capabilities, procedures, technologies, policies and standards through real field tests, facilitating European wide collaboration, cooperation and communication in CM and improving cross-fertilisation between MS organisations. The impact of ACRIMAS will provide a solid basis for the description of Phase II, as well as the sequencing and description of the research areas for the future Security Work Programmes.

The technology addresses the public urban piping systems, e.g. for water, gas or district heating, which are today almost fully mechanical, manually controlled and extremely vulnerable with respect to criminal interventions or terroristic attacks. The ACT4INFRA technology has been developed within the past years by the German SME company 3S-Antriebe GmbH. Core of the innovation is a patented rotationally locked support plate (‘System Berliner Kappe’), which enables retrofitting of automated actuators in already existing valves without flanging and without a manhole. Additionally, the actuators have been optimized for low energy consumption and can operate fully decentralized powered by batteries. The entire system is controlled by safety-approved wireless communication systems, fulfilling the strong requirements of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). No construction work for cabling and no switching cabinet is required. The ACT4INFRA system is a key enabling technology for low cost  retrofitting in order to protect vital urban infrastructure against unauthorized access. This allows to implement smart and secure networks of piping systems. Within ACT4INFRA, 3S strives for systematic market development, distribution strategy and effective international commercialization of this technology on abroad, international mass markets.

The ideal solution is a robust in-situ method for rapid non-invasive detection of hazardous materials, including explosives, that is portable and can be located at borders, ports and other sensitive targets around Europe.\nThe most powerful and promising method being adopted for in-situ observations of suspicious substances to detect explosive is Raman spectroscopy.

However, Raman observations thus far have proven unreliable in the field, due to the very weak signal strength, background fluorescence masking this signal and complicated spectral returns that are difficult to interpret in the field.  \nIn this project ISI will seek to develop an Advanced Intelligent Raman system (AIRS) that builds on the strengths of the Raman observational approach, and dramatically reduces it current limitations of existing instrumentation. \nAIRS will achieve this by combining three technology development to produce a new portable easy to use chemical identification instrument.

The need for more agility in software development and maintenance has also fostered the transition to micro-services architectures, and the wide adoption of this paradigm has led service developers to protect their applications by including virtualised instances of security appliances in their design. Unfortunately, this often results in security being managed by people without enough skills or specific expertise, it may not be able to cope with threats coming from the virtualization layer itself (e.g., hypervisor bugs), and also exposes security appliances to the same threats as the other application components. It also complicates legal interception and investigation when some applications or services are suspected of illegal activity.\nTo overcome the above limitations, the ASTRID project aims at shifting the detection and analysis logic outside of the service graph, by leveraging descriptive context models and their usage in ever smarter orchestration logic, hence shifting the responsibility for security, privacy, and trustworthiness from developers or end users to service providers. This approach brings new opportunities for situational awareness in the growing domain of virtualised services: unified access and encryption management, correlation of events and information among different services/applications, support for legal interception and forensics investigation.\nASTRID will develop a common approach easily portable to different virtualisation scenarios. In this respect, the technology developed by the Project will be validated in two relevant domains, i.e., plain cloud applications and Network Function Virtualisation, which typically exploits rather different chaining and orchestration models.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786922", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "214855", "euroscivoc": "[\"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software/software development\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security Focus Area", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DS-07-2017", "topicName": "Cybersecurity PPP: Addressing Advanced Cyber Security Threats and Threat Actors", "payments": 10.0, "beneficiaries": 10.0, "amount": 2932297.5, "startDate": "2018-05-01", "endDate": "2021-04-30"}, {"id": 57.0, "name": "AT 2017-2019", "programme": "Internal Security Fund", "description": null, "sourceUrl": null, "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": null, "euroscivoc": null, "theme": null, "workProgramme": null, "callId": null, "callName": null, "callArea": null, "topicCode": null, "topicName": null, "payments": 4.0, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "amount": 322583770.0, "startDate": "2017-01-01", "endDate": "2019-12-31"}, {"id": 58.0, "name": "AT FSI-POLICE", "programme": "Internal Security Fund", "description": null, "sourceUrl": null, "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": null, "euroscivoc": null, "theme": null, "workProgramme": null, "callId": null, "callName": null, "callArea": null, "topicCode": null, "topicName": null, "payments": 4.0, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "amount": 140899446.0, "startDate": "2014-01-01", "endDate": "2016-12-31"}, {"id": 59.0, "name": "ATENA - Advanced Tools to assEss and mitigate the criticality of ICT compoNents and their dependencies over Critical InfrAstructures", "programme": "Horizon 2020", "description": "Over recent years, Industrial and Automation Control Systems (IACS) adopted in Critical Infrastructures (CIs) have become more complex due to the increasing number of interconnected devices, and to the large amount of information exchanged among system components.

Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices.

The BOOSTER project addresses this requirement under Security Topic SEC-2009-4.3.2 – Bio-dosimetric tools to manage radiological casualties. Current biodosimetric approaches frequently involve cytogenetics. The analysis of dicentric/ ring chromosomes is the mechanism of choice for precise estimation of an individual’s exposure. Current optimisation of such analyses involves the automation of various steps in the process. However, chromosome analyses are performed on the first mitosis post-exposure and thus a significant limiting factor remains a cell culture step (2 days) that is impossible to reduce. New biodosimeters are required that may not bring the same precision as cytogenetic analysis but will permit triage in the first hours post-accident into three populations (i.e. to identify individuals that require no further intervention, those who require close follow-up and those who require hospitalisation). BOOSTER is a capability project designed to research and develop new bio-dosimetric tools in order to quickly evaluate the level of potential casualties, determine by appropriate sensors their consequences, allow an efficient triage of exposed people, integrate a useful and usable toolbox, train civil protection operators and define commercial exploitation potentialities.

In this respect, C2-SENSE project's main objective is to develop a profile based Emergency Interoperability Framework by the use of existing standards and semantically enriched Web services to expose the functionalities of C2 Systems, Sensor Systems and other emergency/crisis management systems. This will be developed in three steps: (1) first, an Emergency Domain Inventory will be created by surveying existing standards, real life use cases of sensors, devices, C2 systems and emergency management architectures for different scenarios in security field.  (2) Based on this inventory, a common Emergency Domain Ontology will be developed to gather all stakeholders' knowledge in a unique and flexible data model.

While those initiatives offer invaluable insights, CLISEL is based on the presumption that many indirect impacts on Europe’s security emerge and are felt at the local scale, within Europe itself.

In particular, CLISEL looks at the issue of climate-induced migration, an issue often cited as an indirect security dimension of climate change, from the perspective of local administrators in Sardinia.

Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. \nThe goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes. The use of sophisticated proxy cryptography schemes will enable a secure and privacy preserving information sharing network for cloud-based identity information in which even the identity provider cannot access the data in plain-text and hence protect access to identity data. We focus not only on evaluating and applying novel crypto-approaches for IAMs but also on implementing them in an easy-to-use way to motivate secure handling of identity data. \nIn order to also address security, privacy and trust issues related to the used cloud platforms and services we will investigate assurance and resilience approaches for enhancing underlying cloud services.

Reaching beyond the technology focused boundaries of classical information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity includes organizational and behavioural aspects of IT systems and also needs to comply to the currently actively developing legal and regulatory framework for cybersecurity. For example, the European Union recently passed the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive that obliges member states to get in line with the EU strategy. While large corporations might have the resources to follow those developments and bring their IT infrastructure and services in line with the requirements, the burden for smaller organizations like local public administration will be substantial and the required resources might not be available.\nNew and innovative solutions that will help local public administration to ease the burden of being in line with cybersecurity requirements are needed. For example, cooperation and coordination is one of the major aspects of the NIS and EU cybersecurity strategy. An enabling technology for cooperation and coordination is cyber situational awareness and information sharing of cyber incidents. In this project we propose a cybersecurity situational awareness solution for local public administrations that, based on an analysis of the context provides automatic incident detection and visualization, and enables information exchange with relevant national and EU level NIS authorities like CERTs.

Known techniques, as fluorescence will be improved by mean of novel proteins, as antibodies to extend Probability of Detection (PoD). The techniques are: 1. A low cost, high data throughput sensing technique, based on UV-Vis-NIR fluorescence. Fluorescence will be enhanced by development of Organic macro-molecules sensitive to specific classes of compounds of interest (ephedrine, pseudoephedryne, P2P, …) in the domain of drug detection. The fluorescence analysis will be based on an ‘opto-chip’ which can incorporate an array of different properly engineered fluorescent chemical protein able to bind to the analytes with an ‘immuno-type’ reaction.

Novel technologies will be developed, based on distributed ledgers and blockchains, to monitor devices’ integrity state and network behaviour that will considerably increase the detection and response capabilities against targeted and interdisciplinary cyber-attacks. In the case of alleged malicious activity, tools for collecting and storing forensic evidence on a tamper-proof blockchain structure will be delivered, taking into account the specific needs of law enforcement agencies. Privacy-preserving network monitoring and advanced virtual reality-based visualisation techniques will be employed for quickly detecting botnets, DDoS attacks and other incidents. Relying on interdisciplinary research, an intelligent autonomous cyber-defence framework will be built for providing\nintelligent ways of isolating the devices under an attacker’s control (or infected) and effectively responding to and mitigating large-scale attacks.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786698", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "214839", "euroscivoc": "[\"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet/internet of things\", \"/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet\", \"/social sciences/law\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security Focus Area", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DS-07-2017", "topicName": "Cybersecurity PPP: Addressing Advanced Cyber Security Threats and Threat Actors", "payments": 10.0, "beneficiaries": 10.0, "amount": 2996182.5, "startDate": "2018-05-01", "endDate": "2021-04-30"}, {"id": 209.0, "name": "CYBERROAD - Development of the CYBER crime and CYBER terrorism reseach ROADmap", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "This project will identify current and future issues  in the fight against Cyber crime and cyber terrorism in order to draw a roadmap for cyber security research.

A non-scanning LIT allows selective ion monitoring of target threat molecules using optimal voltages for each ion mass without performing a full mass spectral scan. This result is higher sensitivity, simpler control electronics, smaller size, lower power consumption and cost. The limits of detection of LIT-MS instrument are in low parts per billion (ppb) with parts per trillion (ppt) levels achievable with suitable analyte enrichment provided by a pre-concentrator.

Such attacks could be performed blocking communication from central SCADA to local equipments or inserting fake commands/measurements in the SCADA-field equipment communications (as happened with STUXNET worm). The paradox is that critical infrastructures massively rely on the newest interconnected (and vulnerable) ICT technologies, while the control equipment is typically old, legacy software/hardware. Such a combination of factors may lead to very dangerous situations, exposing systems to a wide variety of attacks. To overcome such threats, the CockpitCI project aims on one hand to continue the work done in MICIE by refining and updating the on-line Risk Predictor deployed in the SCADA centre, on the other hand to provide some kind of intelligence to field equipment, allowing them to perform local decisions in order to self-identify and self-react to abnormal situations induced by cyber attacks.

Cyber-crime has led to the loss of up to 150,000 jobs in Europe, which is about 0.6% of the total unemployed population. In response to cyber-crime, we initiated ‘ConnectProtect’ in 2012, a total cyber protection service for SMEs and residential customers.\n\nWe worked with about 20 SMEs in the UK to build this service and up to date, we developed a reporting engine capable of correlating events/logs from multiple security products across multiple organisations and constantly updating each event in real-time to generate the relevant classification of potential threat. The report engine is able to generate a case for our engineers to deal with an incident in real-time and allowing the customer to view their security state via a dashboard. We aim to further establish and understand our target market and conduct a detailed Europe wide cyber-security market study to establish the size and dynamics of the small business market; engage developmental, operational, and marketing partners for successful delivery of this project.\n\nWe also seek to develop an Intellectual Property (IP) strategy to protect our solution from exploitation by other parties. Through this project we will reduce the cyber security burden in the EU from an average of €280 to between €10 and €70 per employee per month and we will create over 100 jobs through native sales language teams that would be set up in our various target countries.

The underlying concept of DOGANA is that Social Vulnerabilities Assessments (SVAs), when regularly performed with the help of an efficient framework, help deploy effective mitigation strategies and lead to reducing the risk created by modern Social Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. Two relevant features of the proposed framework are: i) the presence of the 'awareness' component within the framework as the cornerstone of the mitigation activities; ii) the legal compliance by design of the whole framework, that will be ensured by a partner and a  work package explicitly devoted to this task. Moreover, the outcomes of the project are also expected to provide a solid basis to revise the insurance models for cyber-attacks related risks, thanks to the involvement of 2 strong DOGANA partners in this area of activity.  \nThe project will be implemented by a consortium of 18 partners, from 11 different countries, including users, technology providers of whom 3 are major world-wide cyber-security solutions market leaders as well as legal and psychological expertise.

This is a problem since as societies become more complex, increasing scope and unpredictability of potential crises and faster dynamics of major incidents put increasingly stringent demands on CM. European CM capabilities already constitute a mature System of Systems; hence wholesale redesign would often be too costly and might critically destabilise existing CM capabilities. Therefore DRIVER\\ focuses on augmenting rather than replacing existing capabilities. DRIVER\\ has three main objectives: 1) Develop a pan-European Test-bed for crisis management capability development; 2) Develop a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of crisis management solutions, and 3) Facilitate a shared understanding of crisis management across Europe.\n\nThe DRIVER\\ Test-bed will provide the technological infrastructure, the necessary supporting methodology and adequate support tools. The Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) is a database driven web site that documents all the available DRIVER\\ solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the trials. Initially, the PoS will contain information about the solutions that are already available within the consortium; the PoS will be extended with third-party solutions when required by the trials, and ultimately opened up for any external organisation to share data and experiences on solutions.\n\nA series of trials will be conducted during which solutions will be operationalised and tested. All results of the trials will be stored and made available in the PoS. Several I4CM events will be organized as well as a final conference. In addition to this, a firm link is established and will be maintained with DG HOME’s “Community of Users on Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies” and other European stakeholder groups and relevant initiatives, for instance on standardization.\n\nTo maximise impact beyond the scope of the project and of the DRIVER\\ consortium it is necessary to develop the sustainability of the European Test-bed, the exploitation of the DRIVER Portfolio of Solutions and to promote a European CM community, which shares a common CM understanding and is increasingly willing to share capabilities and collaborate in CM innovation. Together this will boost Europe’s ability to continue adapting to new threats and emerging needs, laying the basis for a continuously resilient EU and providing a mechanism to drive innovation in European CM by bridging the gap from practitioners need and R&D to the market.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607798", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "188608", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management\", \"/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgramme": "2013.0", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Restoring security and safety in case of crisis", "callArea": "Preparedness, prevention, mitigation and planning", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.4.1-1", "topicName": "Phase II demonstration programme on aftermath crisis management", "payments": 42.0, "beneficiaries": 42.0, "amount": 33468209.0, "startDate": "2014-05-01", "endDate": "2020-04-30"}, {"id": 279.0, "name": "Data masses tietojärjestelmäarkkiteht uuri police work (Diamond)", "programme": "Internal Security Fund", "description": "The funding available for the project will develop and harmonize the police information system architecture.

It combines an automatic, rigorous, distributed and open-source toolkit for protecting e-commerce, with monitoring of the impact of threats in physical space and a campaign for training SMEs and citizens aimed at creating awareness and trust. ENSURESEC addresses the whole gamut of modern e-commerce, from standard physical products purchased online and delivered via post, to entirely virtual products or services delivered online. It addresses threats ranging from maliciously modifying web e-commerce applications or rendering them unavailable to legitimate customers, to delivery issues or fraud committed by insiders or customers. It achieves this by focusing on the common software and physical sensor interfaces that sit along the e-commerce, payment and delivery ecosystem. At technical level, it integrates proven state-of-the-art inductive (machine learning) with deductive (formal methods) reasoning tools and techniques so that e-commerce operations are protected by design, as well as through continuous monitoring, response, recovery and mitigation measures at run-time. Importantly, trust of the infrastructure’s operations among its users is established, benefiting from distributed ledger technology ensuring transparency of the operations and that information has not been modified. Although ENSURESEC innovations are applicable to any critical infrastructure that relies and is monitored by networked software systems, its design and integration philosophy make it uniquely prepared to protect distributed and evolving e-commerce infrastructures with its various forms of payment and delivery (virtual, online and physical).

The information security market players have tried to provide suitable solutions to cope with issues such as i) lack of means to provide higher level of assurance (e.g continuous monitoring and auditing), ii) privacy not adequately taken into account, iii) limited transparency and iv) lack of means to streamline risk management and compliance.

The project EU-SEC will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing approaches for assurance and compliance.  The EU-SEC aims to create a framework under which existing, certification and assurance approaches can co-exist. The three core ideas behind the EU-SEC project are that an effective and efficient approach to trust, assurance and compliance has to: (1) balance the need of nations and business sectors to develop their specific certification schemas with the need of CSPs to reduce compliance costs (2) avoid that humans (auditors) do activities that can be performed by machines (e.g. collecting data) (3) make sure that accurate and reliable evidences/information are provided to relevant people, in a timely fashion, leveraging as much as possible automatic means.

But also, to increase the understanding of how easily a HME can be created, what basic equipment is necessary and what chemical knowledge is needed by the terrorist.\n\nThe output from EXPEDIA will increase the security of the citizens in Europe both in the sense that chemical inhibition will reduce/ limit or at least make it much harder for terrorists to create HMEs from readily available chemicals. Understanding the terrorist perspective regarding HME production, will directly give input to both first responders and European legislators.\nAs one of the output EXPEDIA will create A European guide for first responders with basic instructions on how to interpret findings on a crime scene when suspected bomb factories have been encountered.\n\nIn order for European legislators to carry out right work in the fight against terrorism, access to accurate data and an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of HMEs and various formulations thereof is of crucial importance. EXPEDIA will feed its produced information about HMEs directly to these groups via appropriate channels.\n\nFinally, EXPEDIA will research for solutions to prevent the misuse of some explosive precursors that have not yet been investigated within the FP7 research programme.

During the last 2 years, the company’s founders have been developing innovative UAV platforms, software applications, payloads, and material technologies. AERDRON has been actively developing an aerial monitoring solution called EXTREMDRON. The EXTREMDRON series of UAVs addresses many of the limitations of products currently available in terms of environmental limitations, material performance, security applications, operating envelope, and flight performance. The EXTREMDRON can operate in extreme environments which would keep other UAVs grounded during security/public safety critical events. \n\nOur last project, ED1 EXTREMDRON was another step in AERDRON strategic roadmap for developing high tech, and industrialized UAVs for professional sensing applications. The ED1 is equipped with a proprietary developed software that configures sensors, cameras, and encrypts communications thru an onboard computer. The ED1 was fully designed, engineered, and manufactured in house per our company’s commitment to home grown innovation.\n\nAERDRON recognizes that Europe/world faces increasing security threats against its civilians, and critical/soft infrastructure targets. The frequency of attacks against civilian soft targets in Europe is alarming, and new technologies must be developed in the coming years to create a counterforce multiplier. There is a real need for aerial monitoring/sensing solutions focused on the protection of heavily populated areas, and critical/soft infrastructures. AERDRON proposal EXTREMDRON focuses on a creating a NexGen UAV for aerial monitoring applications in extreme operating environments (fires, radiation/nuclear, hazardous chemicals). This niche UAV application has not been successfully realized by any products currently on the market, and there is a real world need for these capabilities to save lives, and critical infrastructures. The EXTREMDRON provides a means to monitor and collect data in extreme environments for security agencies to analyze, collect data, identify threats, and means to rapidly respond to life critical situations which ground crews cannot enter an area for safety reasons. The EXTREMDRON also provides industries/government agencies the means to measure dangerous airborne substances at the disaster location, and its dissipation over populated areas. The EXTREMDRON will be a valuable tool in protecting public safety, and critical infrastructures.  \n\nAERDRON plans to carry out a small-scale demonstration of our innovative prototype EXTREMDRON with the aim of adjusting the physical scale of the UAV (ED2). Some of the activities include: test and adapt new raw materials, perform product design, define the production process and demonstrate and validate its efficacy in small scale actions. But before a rigorous business plan has to be carried out, we need to study of physical scale needs, deploy and classify possible raw materials requirements, establish a production forecast, and estimate the amount of investment in the product manufacturing system, carry out study of legal viability, including IPR issues, carry out a market research and complete a business plan scoping 10 years.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/717915", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "201726", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software\", \"/social sciences/economics and business\", \"/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/robotics/autonomous robots/drones\", \"/engineering and technology/mechanical engineering/vehicle engineering/aerospace engineering\", \"/engineering and technology/mechanical engineering/vehicle engineering/aerospace engineering/aircraft\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DRS-17-2015-1", "topicName": "SME instrument topic: “Protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures”", "payments": 1.0, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "amount": 50000.0, "startDate": "2016-04-01", "endDate": "2016-07-31"}, {"id": 386.0, "name": "Effective alert and assistance chain and situation management (THAT)", "programme": "Internal Security Fund", "description": "The THAT project is part of the KEJO project, a joint project of the Police, Customs, Social and Health Services, the Border Guard, the Rescue Service and the Finnish Defense Forces, which aims to develop a shared field system that supports the activities of security authorities .

In fact, in May 2014 the European Central Bank (ECB) published a list of recommendations for increased banking security and biometrics was included as one of the most secure authentication methods. Concerns about banking security have always existed, but it has been after the breakthrough of online and mobile banking when bank fraud has become major issue to address with urgency. Currently, banking authentication is typically done by using 4-6 digits PIN codes. This form of authentication provides an extremely low security, especially in online banking where cybercriminals can hack this PIN code in a matter of seconds. As a result, the total value of fraudulent transactions is rapidly increasing year by year, being now estimated at €1.44 billion solely in Europe. In this scenario, biometrics holds great promise to become a reference banking authentication method in a near future. However, despite the clear opportunity there are still some barriers preventing the banking biometrics breakthrough, at least on a large scale.\nFacePhi has developed a face recognition technology, specifically designed to overcome the current barriers preventing the large scale deployment of banking biometrics.

This extra flexibility over classical encryption is a powerful enabler for many emerging security technologies (i.e. controlled access, searching and computing on encrypted data, program obfuscation…). \nFENTEC’s mission is to make the functional encryption paradigm ready for wide-range applications, integrating it in ICT technologies as naturally as classical encryption. The primary objective is the efficient and application-oriented development of functional encryption systems.

Almost all such knowledge can be abused or cause damage through inadequate use. In a free society this should not hinder free generation and exchange of knowledge. As the pace of science-based development accelerates, there is a pressing need for continual scanning of the unfolding technology landscape for potential security threats. Looking ahead to 2030, the foresight study will identify and assess security threats that could stem from future technologies. Robotics, Cognition, New Materials, Nano and Biotechnologies are some of the fields to be scanned. FESTOS will stimulate an 'out of the box' anticipatory thinking and construct threat scenarios by analysing the impact of the identified threats on the background of envisioned “security climates” (societal context of security issues). The threat scenarios will be evaluated in terms of their levels of impact and uncertainty. In conjunction with each scenarios critical early-warning indicators will be identified, namely signals that hint at a growing likelihood of specific scenarios and thus provide basis for possible prevention means. Societal issues will be discussed, as well as the controversial issue of controlled dissemination of scientific knowledge in the context of necessary trade-offs between security and the freedom of research and knowledge. Finally policy recommendations will be derived, aiming at novel means of preparedness. Adequate mix of Foresight methods will be employed, e.g. horizon scanning, weak signals analysis, expert surveys, brainstormings, “futures wheel”, interactive scenario building, STEEPV analysis.

Innovative training curricula, guiding cyber-security professionals to implement and combine security measures using new technologies and established learning methodologies, will be created and employed for training needs; they will be linked to professional certification programs and be supported by learning platforms. Aside from the development of skills, the project aims at a holistic approach to cyber-threat management with the ultimate goal of cultivating a strong security culture. As such, the project puts considerable emphasis on research and development (i.e. research on cyber-threats, development of novel ideas, etc) as the key to increasing training dynamics and awareness methods for exceeding the rate of evolution of cyber-attackers", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/833673", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "222628", "euroscivoc": "[\"/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electrical engineering/power engineering/electric power transmission\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "Work Programme 2018-20", "callId": null, "callName": "Security", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "SU-DS01-2018", "topicName": "Cybersecurity preparedness - cyber range, simulation and economics", "payments": 24.0, "beneficiaries": 24.0, "amount": 5997018.5, "startDate": "2019-10-01", "endDate": "2022-09-30"}, {"id": 442.0, "name": "FORLAB - Forensic Laboratory for in-situ evidence analysis in a post blast scenario", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "'An improvised explosive device (IED) post-blast scenario is a vast area where massive and diverse evidences must be searched, collected and transferred for analysis to a distant reference laboratory.

Criminal offenders use phones to communicate, coordinate, organise and execute criminal actions. This is especially true for organised crime and terrorist organisations. This development provides new challenges for criminal prosecution and it is vital to empower law enforcement to access the data stored on mobile devices to use it as court evidence in a trustworthy and reliable manner.  The overarching objective of FORMOBILE is to establish a complete end to end forensic investigation chain, targeting for mobile devices. To achieve this goal three objectives will be pursued. Novel tools shall be developed that include the acquisition of previously unavailable mobile data, unlocking mobile devices, as well as the decoding and analysis of mobile data. Based on the definition of requirements of law enforcement and legal and ethical issues a new mobile forensics standard shall be developed. With the developments of the new standard and the new tools, training for police and criminal prosecution will be established, providing the end users with the latest knowledge in a novel and an innovative curriculum to ensure a quality standard of investigations.   The European Union has developed as a Security Union, building on the European Agenda on Security. This aims to ensure that people live in an area of freedom, security and justice, without internal frontiers. To strengthen digital forensics in the context of criminal investigations is crucial to achieve this vision. FORMOBILE contributes to the fight against virtually all forms of crime. This is because mobile devices are widely used in crimes, especially in the arrangement of conspiracies. Yet, there are crimes more closely related to mobile devices; this includes child abuse and emerging forms of cybercrime in particular.

The algorithm design will be accompanied with implementation and performance evaluation, as well as formal security analysis in the full range of TPM environments: i.e. hardware, software and virtualization environments. Use cases in online banking, activity tracking and device management will provide environments and applications to validate the FutureTPM framework.\n\nSecurity, privacy and trust in a computing system are usually achieved using tamper-resistant devices to provide core cryptographic and security functions. The TPM is one such device and provides the system with a root-of-trust and a cryptographic engine. However, to sustain this enhanced system security it is crucial that the crypto functions in the TPM are not merely secure for today but will also remain secure in the long-term against quantum attacks.\n\nFutureTPM will address this challenge by providing robust and provably-secure QR algorithms for a new generation of TPMs. Research on quantum computers has drawn enormous attention from governments and industry; if, as predicted, a large-scale quantum computer becomes a reality within the next 15 years, existing public-key algorithms will be open to attack. Any significant change to a TPM takes time and requires theoretical and practical research before adoption. Therefore, to ensure a smooth transition to QR cryptography we should start now. A key strategic objective of FutureTPM is to contribute to standardization efforts at EU level within TCG, ISO/IEC and ETSI. The consortium consists of high calibre industrial and academic partners from across Europe, combining QR crypto researchers with TPM developers.

This toolbox would provide (1) procedures, sampling methods and detection of CBRN agents at the crime scene, (2) traditional forensic laboratory methods for contaminated evidence and (3) laboratory methods for profiling the CBRN agents released at the incident. The procedures and methods are will be set up and validated according to ISO17025 and the system validation will be performed by a final exercise. Procedures for chain of custody, QC to ensure the integrity of the evidence and investigations done on the evidence from crime scene to court will be developed. An education and training curriculum related to the developed procedures, best practices and methods will be designed and progressed to implementation.\nUnderpinning the above aims, research will be carried out to develop novel methodologies to enable traditional forensic science (DNA, fingerprint and electronic devices) to be carried out on CBRN contaminated exhibits and analytical procedures to be carried out that not only provide information about the CBRN agent itself but also through CBRN profiling provide in-depth information which can give valuable forensic information, for example points of origin.\nThe project team includes forensic research laboratories, potential users of the expected developments, including public and private users, and SMEs who will be able to bring the new technologies developed within the project to market.'", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/608100", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "192217", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\", \"/medical and health sciences/other medical sciences/forensic science\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgramme": "2013.0", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Security of citizens", "callArea": "CBRN protection", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.1.5-1", "topicName": "European toolbox, focusing on procedures, practices and guidelines for CBRN forensic aspects – Capability Project", "payments": 20.0, "beneficiaries": 20.0, "amount": 5463924.8, "startDate": "2014-09-01", "endDate": "2017-08-31"}, {"id": 507.0, "name": "GLOBE - European Global Border Environment", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "The GLOBE project will provide a comprehensive framework in which an integrated global border management system must be developed.

Recommended procedures for explosive detection are inherently unsafe: due to current technological limitations, EU regulations only prescribe screenings on a variable percentage of randomly chosen passengers. Being not portable, such devices can only be installed at screening lines - but in Brussels 2016 explosions happened way before them. Moreover, existing devices just allow to analyse swabbed points instead of the passengers’ total body. In the meantime, those procedures are slow (up to 30 s/passenger) and intrusive, requiring physical contact (swabbing): two major drawbacks, considering that airports competition is based today on passenger experience. \nEye on Air developed I-MUST, a handheld disruptive device based on a proprietary, ultra-thin and high sensitive Ion Mobility Spectrometry sensor.  Embedded into I-MUST, it ensures the most secure detection of explosives, with a sensitivity 500 times higher than its competitors (0.1 ppb) and the detection of  >150 compounds, i.e. 3 to 5 times more compounds than currently used technology.

IDetecT 4ALL goal is to develop an innovative, Optical Intruder Sensing and Authentication Technology, that will dramatically improve the Cost/Performance ratio of security systems, thus becoming an enabler for the widespread availability of reliable and affordable security, leading to more CIs being protected. iDetecT 4ALL proposes to develop a novel Photonic Sensing technology based on an innovative approach utilizing ultra low cost electro-optical components. This novel approach enables to detect and Authenticate objects by a single sensor. The suggested concept is based on illuminating the protected area with invisible, modulated light, and by using a solid state scanning and detecting technique, to continuously monitor the 3D surface profile within the protected area.  Presence and location of intruders will be detected from the variations inflicted on this 3D profile.

Radiation Monitors are effective to detect unshielded or partially shielded nuclear and radioactive materials in lightly loaded vehicles or cargos, and less effective at dense or high attenuating vehicles. In addition, the radiation monitors are not effective to detect shielding (e.g. lead) inside the vehicles that are capable to transport large masses of shielding material. Specifically, one of the biggest gaps is that some SNMs emit very low level of radiation. The X-ray cannot clear every dense object found in the image. Active interrogation can be used to clear the alarms; however, they produce high radiation that requires shielded facility, and require passengers not to remain in the vehicle during the inspection.  Therefore, there is a need for inspection systems that can penetrate high attenuating vehicles, be specific to nuclear and shielding materials and that can be steal from the sites. .

This is a result of both basic exposure and dependencies between infrastructures. Because of prohibitive costs, the paradigm of protection against extreme events is expanding and now also encompasses the paradigm of resilience. In addition to strengthening and securing systems; system design objectives are now being set, and response planning is being carried out, to facilitate a fast recovery of infrastructure following a large scale incident. \nWith an interconnected European society, countries and infrastructures are increasingly reliant upon their neighbours, both under normal operating conditions and in the event of an incident. Despite this, there is no common European methodology for measuring resilience or for implementing resilience concepts, and different countries and sectors employ their own techniques. There is also no shared, well-developed system-of-systems approach, which would be able to test the effects of dependencies and interdependencies between individual critical infrastructures and sectors. This increases the risk as a result of reliance on critical infrastructures, as well as affects the ability for sharing resources for incident planning due to no common terminology or means of expressing risk. \nThe overall objective of IMPROVER is to improve European critical infrastructure resilience to crises and disasters through the implementation of combinations of societal, organisational and technological resilience concepts to real life examples of pan-European significance, including cross-border examples. This implementation will be enabled through the development of a methodology based on risk evaluation techniques and informed by a review of the positive impact of different resilience concepts on critical infrastructures.

Earthquake Induced Liquefaction Disasters (EILDs) is responsible for tremendous amounts of the structural damages and fatalities; with experiences from recent events giving example of where approx. half of the economic loss was directly caused by liquefaction. Liquefaction is a phenomenon, with previously a low profile until recent earthquake events, in which the stiffness and strength of soil is reduced by seismic activity. With the causes of Liquefaction being known, it is important to recognize the factors that contribute to its occurrence; as well as the resulting hazards. The theory on how to address the subject has been comprehensive, as well as the engineering to reduce its consequences of liquefaction already developed; however, recent findings and advances need to be accurately examined in order to implement mitigation strategies practically. A systematic approach is needed for assessing the possibility of liquefaction on a site, prior to construction, then implementing the most appropriate liquefaction mitigation techniques. However, the variability of circumstances, invariably translates to multiple approaches of implementation, based on the susceptibility of the location to liquefaction, as well as the type and size of structure. The LIQUEFACT project addresses the mitigation of risks to EILD events in European communities with a holistic approach. The project not only deals with the resistance of structures to EILD events, but also, the resilience of the collective urban community in relation to their quick recovery from an occurrence.

Our capability to deal with this threat is challenged by the terrorists’ capability to easily manufacture explosives from common components. LOTUS will address the critical issue of detecting bomb (and drugs) factories. The concept and objectives of the LOTUS project are to create a system by which illicit production of explosives and drugs can be detected during the preparation and production phase of a terrorist plot. LOTUS provides intelligence of a sort that is otherwise not available. This intelligence covers a gap where little information is available from other sources. Detection in this phase has advantages compared to detection of the explosives themselves during e.g. the transportation phase. The LOTUS project main activities are measurement of the dispersion of pre-cursors at production and surveillance system development. The system capability will be demonstrated by adapting existing and emerging sensors for detection of selected precursors, and integrating the sensors in a networked system. By using existing global infrastructures for positioning (GPS) and networking (GSM) the LOTUS system can be used more or less anywhere in the world with small costs for supporting installations and personnel.

Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. €1.44 billion annually and €14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to €13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user’s mobile device to determine his/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%.

Along with police statistics, CVSs have become an internationally recognized tool for identifying and analysing factors affecting public and personal perceptions of insecurity. Perception of insecurity arises as a very heterogeneous concept not limited to actual crime rates but encompassing a wide range of other aspects including personal wellbeing, trust in public institutions, justice and social integration. MARGIN addresses the topic of insecurity by taking into account its heterogeneity. Based on previous and on-going research activities, the project's specific aims are: (1) to create a framework enabling end-users to contrast objective and subjective measures of insecurity (i.e. compare police statistics with CVS data), (2) to develop and validate a thematic survey with a sample of 15.400 citizens that allows for the assessment of the impact of demographic, socio-economic and socio-geographic variables on the perception of insecurity (3) to investigate the socio-cultural determinants of insecurity perception through the implementation of anthropological fieldwork in five EU countries (4) to share best practices and outcomes in a final event with 100 key end-users.

Over 185 mooring lines have been lost in this period creating a damage of over 1 million Euro each. The offshore wind industry has started to install thousands of structures offshore and require condition monitoring by law (i.e. HSB requirements in Germany).\nCondition monitoring using ambient vibrations has a good reputation onshore already.

These methods differ in their specificity and sensitivity to radiation, the stability of signal and speed of performance. A large scale radiological emergency can take different forms. Based on the emergency scenario different biodosimetric tools should be applied so that the dosimetric information can be made available with optimal speed and precision. The aim of this multi-disciplinary collaborative project is to analyse a variety of biodosimetric tools and adapt them to different mass casualty scenarios. The following biodosimetric tools will be validated and established: the dicentric assay, the micronucleus assay, the gamma-H2AX assay, the skin speckle assay, the blood serum protein expression assay and EPR/OSL dosimetry in components of pocket electronic devises. The assays were chosen because they complement each other with respect to sensitivity, specificity to radiation and the exposure scenario as well as speed of performance. The project will involve the key European players with extensive experience in biological dosimetry. Training will be carried out and automation and commercialisation pursued. An operational guide will be developed and disseminated among emergency preparedness and radiation protection organisations.

This includes dry reagent storage of lysis reagents, master mixes for the PCR, antibodies, and liquid storage of buffers. Furthermore, it will be imperative that an on-chip waste storage be included in order to eliminate contamination risk. The overall target is a “sample in, result out”-type handling procedure.\nA reduction of processing times is a further advantage owed to miniaturization and the combination of all biological processes in a small disposable chip instead of different instruments.

Recent devastating attacks across Europe clearly illustrate the increasing threat that exists. \n\nIt is impossible to deploy security personnel in sufficient numbers to protect every location.

While tokens can still be stolen or transferred to other persons, biometrics technology can provide reliable, cost-effective and user-friendly solutions.\nThe proliferation of smart services calls for unsupervised authentication at a distance. Being natural, non-intrusive and readily compatible with smart and mobile devices, automatic speaker verification (ASV) is an appealing solution. Even so, today’s state-of-the-art ASV systems lack robustness to environmental variability and are vulnerable to spoofing. Concerns regarding interoperability, scalability and privacy also form barriers to exploitation.\nWhile embracing standards, in addition to a privacy and interoperability-by-design ethos, OCTAVE will integrate commercial-grade and new, hybrid ASV systems with the latest environmental robustness and anti-spoofing technologies to deliver a scalable, trusted biometric authentication service (TBAS). While simultaneously relieving end-users from the inconvenience of dealing with textual passwords, the OCTAVE platform will reduce the economic and practical burdens related to password loss and recovery.

Indeed, if users are strongly identified during a transaction, then privacy is non-existent. Nevertheless, there exist mechanisms that can reconcile privacy and strong identity, either by trusting an online identity provider (IDP), or by using cryptographic mechanisms such as anonymous credentials.\n \nThe former approach, made popular by technologies such as SAML, OpenID Connect, and Facebook Connect, has the disadvantage that the IDP forms a single point of failure in terms of privacy and security, because it can impersonate and track its users online. The latter approach has the disadvantage that users have to rely on trusted hardware such as smartcards to protect credentials from compromise and from illegitimate sharing.\n \nOLYMPUS will take a radically new approach offering the seamless user experience of online IDPs, but without their drawbacks. Namely, OLYMPUS will pioneer the concept of distributed oblivious identity management, where the role of the IDP is split over multiple authorities, so that no single authority can track or impersonate their users. By exploiting advanced techniques based on threshold cryptography, the OLYMPUS framework will let users maintain unlinkable identities with different service providers while using standard devices and a single password or biometric.\n \nBy leveraging existing eID solutions to create a strong link to physical identities, and by integrating into existing frameworks to ease adoption by service providers, OLYMPUS will establish a secure and interoperable European identity management framework. Its practical feasibility and relevance will be demonstrated in two pilots. The first combines the framework with soft identity proofs to build a mobile driver license application that can be used for offline purchases of restricted goods.

The protection of critical infrastructure is a significant objective of the EU, and access control systems represent a considerable part of it. A major part of electronic access control systems use smart cards, which however are very impractical due to the number of these cards people use every day. Two SEs in OneCard assure hardware separation of application domains requiring extra safety, therefore it can be used instead of several smart cards. The NFC antenna and communication of our product are patented. There is no need to buy an expensive phone with NFC which results in great independence. With OneCard R-DAS can significantly advance  together with the progressive growth of the NFC and access control market.\nOur business concept is based on B2B – our customers are providers of access control services and systems. Owing to OneCard, they may offer higher quality and cheaper services without the need of changing their technology and infrastructure.

In last years a not correct management of emergencies often created critical situations. In the happening of a catastrophic event, it is human behaviour-- and often human behaviour alone--that determines the speed and efficacy of the crisis management efforts. Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise. Table top exercises are low cost and can be easily and frequently organized, but it cannot recreate the real atmosphere, (e.g. stress, confusion) and need to keep critical decisions in very little time. On the other hand, crisis managers trained through simulation exercises on the field can be very effective, but such a simulations are very expensive and cannot be easily and quickly organized. PANDORA will bridge the gap between table-top exercises and real world simulation exercises, providing a near-real training environment at affordable cost. In a real-time, physics-based environment, PANDORA authentically simulates all the dynamic elements of the entire disaster environment. PANDORA will emulate a complete crisis room: realistic 3D visuals and audio create a truly immersive, chaotic and stressful environment.

If the perpetrator’s objectives can be met solely through the creation of human illness, death and associated panic, this may be appropriate. However, if economic and political vulnerabilities are included as contributing factors, agricultural bioterrorism must be considered among other possible avenues of attack.\nAgricultural bioterrorism (agroterrorism) is a subset of bioterrorism, and it is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease/pest with the goal of generating fear, causing economic losses, and/or undermining stability.\nProgrammes preparing for attacks against agriculture are not new, and have been conducted both by nation-states and by substate organizations throughout history. At least nine countries (Canada, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, USA and the former USSR) had documented agricultural bioweapons programmes during some part of the 20th century. Four other countries (Egypt, North Korea, Rhodesia and Syria) are believed to have or have had agricultural bioweapons programmes.\nIn the mean time, natural outbreaks of diseases demonstrate the destructive potential of an agroterroristic attack.\nRecent trends in biosecurity recommend a shift from a largely national approach to biosecurity towards greater international cooperation. Current capabilities to detect and respond to agroterrorism are limited and spread among many organizations, with a corresponding lack of coordination.\nThe project deals with threats which are multifaceted, interrelated, complex and increasingly transnational in their impact.

In many cases, pathogen contaminations are difficult to detect, and require specialized technologies, tools and procedures to handle them. Pathogens can easily spread via water, and may cause contaminations of large areas far from their origin. Waterborne pathogen contamination events can occur anywhere, and may be caused by various natural events or they can be the result of human activity, either accidental or malicious. During these emergencies, first responders may need to operate within a certain pre-defined incident area, and are likely to be exposed to contaminated water originating from various sources, such as surface water, wastewater or drinking water. This can pose a significant risk of illness, disease or even death, through skin contact, ingestion or inhalation. \n\nThe overall objective of the PathoCERT project is to strengthen the coordination capability of the first responders in handling waterborne pathogen contamination events.

Cyber attacks are made mostly against governments and corporates to gather guarded information, or to disrupt their operation in general. Advanced attackers targeted 5 out of 6 large companies each month in 2014, whereas 60% of all targeted attacks struck small- and medium-sized organisations. The same year companies across all industries worldwide have reported a total of 42.8 million detected\nattacks. And the consequences are varied and serious: crime involving computers and networks has cost the world economy more than $445 billion annually and the cost is expected to reach 1 trillion in 2016. Restroring damages caused by successful cyber attacks is extremely difficult and costly, if not impossible. Moreover, when a security breach occurs, the company or organisation concerned not only loses valuable and/or sensitive data, but it also suffers damage to its brand and reputation that can take a lot of time and money to repair. The increasing cybercrime urges for innovative cyber security solutions that are able to detect and immediately respond to attacks that are highly sophisticated and damaging, which is more important than ever. And this phenomena generates market opportunity for cybersecurity specialty companies.

This regulation will be implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU region and it will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe. To achieve GDPR compliance, organisations will have to secure all communication channels (email, chat, data sharing) with customers, for which end-to-end encryption will play a key role. In such a scenario, companies have no choice than quickly adapt their data protection procedures and acquire technology that complies with the new regulation. \nProtonSuite will is the first cloud-based cybersecure collaboration platform that provides users with end-to-end secure communication channels and collaboration tools. The platform is built following the essence of privacy by design, which means that privacy is taken into account from the inception of the product concept.

As systems become more powerful and, in many aspects, more complex, advanced cyber-attacks impose new threats for important operations of our society. Computer systems assist core functions of hospitals, energy centers, logistics, and communications, to name a few, and compromising such systems may have severe consequences for everyone of us. Despite the evolution of computer systems, current security defenses-although they have been substantially improved in the last decade-seem not really enough to stop advanced cyber attacks. Systems still suffer from vulnerabilities, despite the many active or passive defenses in place that have been developed in the last decades.\n\nWe believe that the core of this problem is that cyber attackers are almost always one step ahead of the cyber security researchers and practitioners. Indeed, cyber attackers are the first to strike, and while researchers try to figure out what happened, attackers have all the time in the world to plan their next strike. In this project we advocate that we should change the rules of the cyber attackers’ game and challenge the asymmetry.

Whilst cryptography can guarantee many security properties, it crucially depends on the ability to keep the used keys secret even in face of determined adversaries. \nOver the last two decades a new type of adversary has emerged, able to obtain, from the cryptographic implementation, side channel leakage such as recording of response times, power or EM signals, etc. To account for such adversaries, sophisticated security certification and evaluation methods (Common Criteria, EMVCo, FIPS…) have been established to give users assurance that security claims have withstood independent evaluation and testing. Recently the reliability of these evaluations has come into the spotlight: the Taiwanese citizen card proved to be insecure, and Snowden’s revelations about NSA's tampering with FIPS standards eroded public confidence.\nREASSURE will (1) improve the efficiency and quality of all aspects of certification using a novel, structured detect-map-exploit approach that will also improve the comparability of independently conducted evaluations, (2) cater for emerging areas such as the IoT by automating leakage assessment practices in order to allow resistance assessment without immediate access to a testing lab, (3) deliver tools to stakeholders, such as reference data sets and an open-source leakage simulator based on instruction-level profiles for a processor relevant for the IoT, (4) improve existing standards by actively pushing the novel results to standardization bodies.\nREASSURE's consortium is ideal to tackle such ambitious tasks.

RESOLUTE is answering those needs, by proposing to conduct a systematic review and assessment of the state of the art of the resilience assessment and management concepts, as a basis for the deployment of an European Resilience Management Guide (ERMG), taking into account that resilience is not about the performance of individual system elements but rather the emerging behaviour associated to intra and inter system interactions. The final goal of RESOLUTE is to adapt and adopt the identified concepts and methods from the defined guidelines for their operationalization and evaluation when addressing Critical Infrastructure (CI) of the Urban Transport System (UTS), through the implementation of the RESOLUTE Collaborative Resilience Assessment and Management Support System (CRAMSS), that adopts a highly synergic approach towards the definition of a resilience model for the next-generation of collaborative emergency services and decision making process.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653460", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "194870", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/economics and business\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\", \"/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DRS-07-2014", "topicName": "Crises and disaster resilience – operationalizing resilience concepts", "payments": 11.0, "beneficiaries": 11.0, "amount": 3848581.0, "startDate": "2015-05-01", "endDate": "2018-04-30"}, {"id": 872.0, "name": "RESPECT - RESPECT – Rules, Expectations & Security through Privacy-Enhanced Convenient Technologies", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "Convenience and cost-effectiveness are the two key considerations for both citizens and security forces when deciding which technologies to embrace or avoid in the Information Society.

The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety.

In addition, a Hybrid Situation Awareness (HSA) application capable of determine the potential consequences of any threat will show the potential cascading effect of a detected threat in the two different domains (physical and cyber).\nOn the other hand, through SAURON approach the public in the surroundings and the rescue/security teams will be able to be informed on any potential event/situation that could put in risk their integrity.\nThus, SAURON proposes as main objective to ensure an adequate level of both physical and cyber protection for the EU ports and limiting, as far as possible, the detrimental effects for the society and citizens of a combined attack (physical & cyber) to an EU port.\nReducing the vulnerabilities of EU ports, as one of the main European critical infrastructures and increasing their systemic resilience in the face of a physical, cyber or combined threat will be also part of the SAURON main objective.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/740477", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "210044", "euroscivoc": "[\"\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Critical Infrastructure Protection", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "CIP-01-2016-2017", "topicName": "Prevention, detection, response and mitigation of the combination of physical and cyber threats to the critical infrastructure of Europe", "payments": 14.0, "beneficiaries": 14.0, "amount": 6926369.5, "startDate": "2017-05-01", "endDate": "2020-09-30"}, {"id": 936.0, "name": "SAVASA - Standards Based Approach to Video Archive Search and Analysis", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "The SAVASA project proposes the creation of a video archive search platform that allows authorised users to perform semantic queries over different, remote and non-interoperable video archives this project will exploit the current trends in computer vision, video retrieval and semantic video analysis.

As more sectors adopt cloud services in their computing environment, the trend will also reach ICT services operating critical infrastructures (CI), such as transportation systems or infrastructure surveillance.\nHosting CI services in the cloud brings with it security and resilience requirements that existing cloud offerings are not well placed to address.  Due to the opacity and elasticity of cloud environ-ments, the risks of deploying CI services in the cloud are difficult to assess – specifically on the technical level, but also from legal or business perspectives. Traditional IT security measures cannot fully tackle the issues (e.g. risk, trust, and resilience) arising from this paradigm shift, especially for operators and manufacturers of CI IT systems. Therefore, the mission of the SECCRIT project is to analyse and evaluate cloud computing technologies with respect to security risks in sensitive environments, and to develop methodologies, technologies, and best practices for creating a secure, trustworthy, and high assurance cloud computing environment for CI.\nIn order to accomplish this mission, the objectives of the SECCRIT project are: identification of the relevant legal framework and establishment of respective guidelines, provision of evidence and data protection for cloud services; understanding and managing risk associated with cloud environments; understanding cloud behaviour in the face of challenges; establishment of best practice for secure cloud service implementations; and the demonstration of SECCRIT research and development results in real-world application scenarios.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312758", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "106660", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgramme": "2012.0", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2012-1", "callName": "Increasing the Security of infrastructures and utilities", "callArea": "Cyber crime", "topicCode": "SEC-2012.2.5-2", "topicName": "Cyber resilience – Secure cloud computing for critical infrastructure - Capability Project", "payments": 10.0, "beneficiaries": 10.0, "amount": 3397319.0, "startDate": "2013-01-01", "endDate": "2015-12-31"}, {"id": 948.0, "name": "SECILE - \"Securing Europe through Counter-Terrorism—Impact, Legitimacy and Effectiveness\"", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "'This project aims to create an empirically-informed view of the legitimacy and effectiveness of European security legislation, taking into account legal, societal, operational and democratic perspectives.

Establishing efficient and effective ways to protect services and infrastructures from ever-evolving cyber threats is crucial for sustaining business integrity and reputation as well as protecting personal and sensitive data.\nTo that end, the SHIELD project proposes a universal solution for dynamically establishing and deploying virtual security infrastructures into ISP and corporate networks. SHIELD builds on the huge momentum of Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), as currently standardised by ETSI, in order to virtualise security appliances into virtual Network Security Functions (vNSFs), to be instantiated within the network infrastructure using NFV technologies and concepts, effectively monitoring and filtering network traffic in a distributed manner. Logs and metrics from vNSFs are aggregated into an information-driven Data Analysis and Remediation Engine (DARE), which leverages state-of-the-art big data storage and analytics in order to predict specific vulnerabilities and attacks by analysing the network and understanding the adversary possibilities, behaviour and intent. \nThe SHIELD virtual security infrastructure can either used by the ISP internally for network monitoring and protection, but it can also be offered as-a-service to ISP customers; for this purpose, SHIELD establishes a “vNSF Store”, i.e. a repository of available virtual security functions (firewalls, DPIs, content filters etc.) from which the ISP customers can select the ones which best match their needs and deploy them to protect their infrastructure. This approach promotes openness and interoperability of security functions and offers an affordable, zero-CAPEX security solution for citizens and SMEs.

The appropriateness of this decision is highly critical as it has a strong impact on the potential success of the operation as well as on the potential impacts, scene environment (e.g. witnesses, involved civilians, etc.) and consequences.\nSo the SHOTPROS project aims to investigate the influence of psychological and contextual human factors (HFs) on the behaviour of decision-making and acting (DMA) of police officers under stress and in high-risk operational situations in order to design better training for police officers to improve DMA Performance. SHOTPROS will develop a Virtual Reality (VR) solution to experimentally assess the degree to which these factors influence DMA behaviour.

Yet new EU regulations and specifically those on information sharing between police and security forces explicitly prohibit automated decision-taking regarding individuals unless “authorised by a law which also lays down measures to safeguard the data subject’s legitimate interests” (art 7, CFD 2008/977/JHA). Where are these laws, what can these measures be and what else should the laws contain? Can the laws be technology-neutral but sector specific, thus permitting a measured approach to the appropriateness of smart surveillance technologies in key security applications? Can they be extended to all security applications of smart surveillance, even those not covered by CFD 2008/977/JHA or the proposed directive set to replace it? This project (SMART) addresses these and other questions through a comprehensive approach which combines a technical review of key application areas by sector with a review of existing pertinent legislation to  then produce a set of guidelines and a model law compliant with CFD 2008/977/JHA and EU Directive 46/95 and the proposed successor legislation. The project first focuses on one meaning of “measures” i.e. it uses expertise from police and security forces from inside and outside the EU to “measure” (as in “calculate”) risk factors in a number of priority application areas for smart surveillance technologies including border control, crowd-control, counter-terrorism and e-government. Bringing together some of Europe’s leading experts on data protection with senior police officers responsible for using surveillance in the most CCTV-intensive cities in the world, SMART evaluates the appropriateness and available safeguards for on-line surveillance and associated risks inherent in data-sharing and exchange. Having thus identified appropriate instances of application as well as a number of technical, procedural and legal options for safeguards, the project moves on to create a tool-kit which would be useful to system designers, policy makers and legislative draughtsmen across Europe (and hopefully beyond). At this stage the project turns to a second meaning of “measures” i.e. it would bring to bear significant EU-wide expertise in data protection legislation in order to prepare a draft model law which would contain a number of measures providing adequate safeguards for the data subject and thus rendering use of smart surveillance compliant with CFD 2008/977/JHA and its proposed successor and other applicable regulations.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261727", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "99234", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/law\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgramme": "2010.0", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2010-1", "callName": "Security and society", "callArea": "Ethics and justice", "topicCode": "SEC-2010.6.5-2", "topicName": "Use of smart surveillance systems, data protection, integrity and sharing information within privacy rules", "payments": 21.0, "beneficiaries": 21.0, "amount": 3456017.35, "startDate": "2011-06-01", "endDate": "2014-05-31"}, {"id": 987.0, "name": "SMARTPREVENT - Smart Video-Surveillance System to Detect and Prevent Local Crimes in Urban Areas", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "The increase in urban population lead to an increase in crime.

The increase of criminal activity is manifested in an increased frequency of small crimes like graffiti, theft, robbery, destruction of rubbish bins. This has had a big impact for local governments, citizens and businesses.\nLocal government agencies are trying to solve these problems. As was shown in New York, a reduction in petty crimes increases the sense of public order which produces further reduction in crime in general. These organizations often treat the problem with classical solutions such as increase in police resources, reintegration of offenders, rehabilitation of degraded areas and modern solutions such as urban video surveillance. However, these new technologies are often underused and inadequate.\nThe SmartPrevent project aims to enhance detection and prevention of crimes in local urban areas by exploiting the full potential of video-surveillance systems. We will develop and provide four important benefits: i) Systematic characterization of usual petty crimes in an area under automatic surveillance; ii) automatic detection of the most usual and frequent criminal activities; iii) a set of automated tools capable of alerting the appropriate responders; and iv) early prevention of crimes by prediction and early detection of crimes.\nRather than providing new methodologies or tools, SmartPrevent will focus on: a) improving already-existing methodologies by means of a set of guidelines for the use of video-surveillance systems; and b) providing a set of tools capable to improve of the existing crime detection systems.

However, in spite of the improvements, modern body armours still have some of the same drawbacks as the old ones, as they are mostly heavy, bulky and rigid. Therefore they limit the wearer’s mobility and agility and are impractical for use on joints, arms, legs, etc. Moreover, body armours have traditionally been designed to protect the wearer against ballistic threats and, thus, they provide only a limited level of protection against knives, sharp blades or sharp-tipped weapons. Recent studies, however, reveal that stab and puncture have become a main cause of police officers' injuries. Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop materials that combine stab and ballistic protection, while retaining their flexibility and low weight.\nIn this context, the proposed project aims to develop optimized ballistic textiles (both woven and spacer knitted fabrics) and apply innovative surface treatments (e.g. shear thickening fluids, ceramic coatings) to improve their performance on an areal density basis. Thus, fewer fabric layers will be required, which is expected to result in increased flexibility and reduced weight of the armour. Main parameters to consider also include physiological comfort and ergonomic design.\nAdditionally, smart functions, including positioning systems, will be integrated to further increase the efficiency of the body armour, eventually leading to reduced casualties.\nFinally, while a main limitation is that existing protective gear is usually limited to the body armour, innovative solutions are herein proposed for the protection of vulnerable body parts other than the torso.'", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607295", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "185484", "euroscivoc": "[\"/engineering and technology/materials engineering/coating and films\", \"/engineering and technology/materials engineering/textiles\", \"/social sciences/law\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgramme": "2013.0", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Security of citizens", "callArea": "Ordinary crime and forensics", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.1.4-1", "topicName": "Smart and protective clothing for law enforcement and first responders – Capability Project", "payments": 10.0, "beneficiaries": 10.0, "amount": 2781067.02, "startDate": "2014-04-01", "endDate": "2017-09-30"}, {"id": 989.0, "name": "SMESEC - Protecting Small and Medium-sized Enterprises digital technology through an innovative cyber-SECurity framework", "programme": "Horizon 2020", "description": "Small and Medium size Enterprises (SMEs) are an important driver for innovation and growth in the EU.

The technology proposed is based on linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry (MS). MS techniques have been increasingly deployed in security sniffing applications in the USA. MS is a non-intrusive high-resolution technique able to detect single atoms and complex molecules through their charged species (ions) or fragmentation pattern. The technique is capable of detecting a wide range of substances rapidly, with high accuracy and with a stand-off capability – critically it is able to detect trace levels below parts per million. Once the MS fingerprint of a unknown substance is measured it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. Sniffles will develop a LIT MS based device with a larger mass range than other comparable MS techniques. Methods for miniaturisation and modularisation will be applied to allow reduced vacuum demand and upgradeability. Miniaturisation will be made possible through improved designs based on results from modelling, novel manufacturing techniques and improvements in the MS drive electronics and vacuum system. These advances will bring benefits including reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility.

Therefore, the SPIRIT Consortium was formed to bring the required expertise together, make these commonly available and to find solutions that can be integrated into normal life and planning and building procedures. Within SPIRIT a terrorist attack with the whole scope of CBRE-threat is addressed. The main outcome of the project is an integrated approach to counter CBRE-threats, including proposed guidelines for a EU Regulatory Framework.

These two principles (partitioning and entanglement) are thus applied holistically across the entire data management stack, from communication to storage and processing.\n\nUsers will control the choice of non-colluding domains for partitioning and the tradeoffs between entanglement and performance, and thus will have full control over what happens to their data. This will make users less reluctant to manage their personal data online due to privacy concerns and will generate positive business cases for privacy-sensitive online applications such as the distributed cloud infrastructure and medical record storage platform that we address.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653884", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "194907", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/economics and business\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security: Cybersecurity, Privacy and Trust", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DS-01-2014", "topicName": "Privacy", "payments": 7.0, "beneficiaries": 7.0, "amount": 2150810.0, "startDate": "2015-09-01", "endDate": "2018-08-31"}, {"id": 1036.0, "name": "SafeShore - System  for  detection of  Threat Agents in  Maritime Border  Environment", "programme": "Horizon 2020", "description": "The main objective of the SafeShore project is to cover existing gaps in coastal border surveillance, increasing internal security by preventing cross-border crime such trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of drugs.

One of the treats to the maritime coast are small Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) which can carry explosives or which can be used for smuggling drugs, boats and human intruders on the sea shore. \n\nThe SafeShore core solution for detecting small targets that are flying at low attitude is to use a 3D LIDAR that scans the sky and creates above the protected area a virtual dome shield. SafeShore will also integrate the 3D LIDAR with passive acoustic sensors, passive radio detection and video analytics.\n\nOne of SafeShore specific objectives will be to cover 1500-m1800m along the coastal border. This will be done with 3 mobile platforms. Each one of those will cover itself with a dome-shaped virtual detection shield with a radius of about 250m to 300m. There will be approximately 50 meters overlapping between the platforms. The overlapping will create a continuous  detection shield along the shore. \n\nThe SafeShore objective will be to demonstrate the detection capabilities in the missing detection gaps of other existing systems such as costal radars, thereby also ensuring the fusion of information and increasing the situational awareness and better implementation of the European Maritime Security Strategy based on the information exchange frameworks, EUROSUR and EUCISE 2020. \n\nAll SafeShore objectives are measurable, realistic and achievable within the duration of the project, as the SafeShore project will build 3 prototypes that are going to assess the accomplishment of the objectives.

Where security solutions involve the collection of information about citizens, questions arise as to whether their privacy has been infringed. This infringement of individual privacy is sometimes seen as an acceptable cost of enhanced security. Similarly, citizens are seen as willing to trade-off their privacy for enhanced personal security in different settings. These common understandings of the security-privacy relationship, both at state and citizen levels, have informed policymakers, legislative developments and best practice guidelines concerning security developments across the EU. However, an emergent body of work questions the validity of the security-privacy trade-off, suggesting that this has over-simplified the consideration of the impact and acceptability of security solutions on citizens in current security policy and practice. Thus, the more complex issues underlying privacy concerns and public scepticism towards surveillance-oriented security solutions (SOSSs) may not be apparent to legal and technological experts. In response to these developments, this project will consult with citizens from several EU member and associated states on the question of the security-privacy trade-off as they evaluate different security solutions. Through extensive preparatory work, the project will identify and empirically examine the influence of a broad range of issues upon their evaluations. Using citizen consultation meetings, questionnaires and innovative visual methods, a representative, fine-grained picture from across Europe will be provided. Further, citizens’ understanding of privacy protection laws, their enforcement, and the acceptance levels of SOSSs, will be explained. Finally, a set of context-dependent dimensions for decision support concerning the acceptability of new SOSSs which promotes civil rights protection will be produced.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285492", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "102076", "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/law\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgramme": "2011.0", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2011-1", "callName": "Security and society", "callArea": "Ethics and justice", "topicCode": "SEC-2011.6.5-2", "topicName": "The relationship between Human privacy and security", "payments": 12.0, "beneficiaries": 12.0, "amount": 3424109.0, "startDate": "2012-02-01", "endDate": "2015-01-31"}, {"id": 1083.0, "name": "System for coastal surveillance", "programme": "Internal Security Fund", "description": null, "sourceUrl": null, "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": null, "euroscivoc": null, "theme": null, "workProgramme": null, "callId": null, "callName": null, "callArea": null, "topicCode": null, "topicName": null, "payments": 2.0, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "amount": 2475229.6, "startDate": "2015-01-07", "endDate": "2017-01-09"}, {"id": 1084.0, "name": "TACTIC - Tools, methods And training for CommuniTIes and Society to better prepare for a Crisis", "programme": "FP7 Security", "description": "The overall aim of the TACTIC project is to increase preparedness to large-scale and cross-border disasters amongst communities and societies in Europe.

E.g. in Germany, grid leakages are controlled by expensive airborne LIDAR monitoring systems. This is especially problematic in urban environments, in which most of the consumers are situated- without viable alternatives, grid operators must accept the cost.\n\nNevertheless, recent advancements in remote measurement technologies enable to develop substantially more effective grid monitoring solutions. For example, THE Systems and its team has already proven the viability of networked accelerometers for continuous grid monitoring tasks (THE Systems has tested the solution in an industrial environment in Finland).\n\nAs a result of this project, THE Systems will combine state of the art accelerometers with advanced signal processing based on computationally efficient algorithms. The uniqueness for urban settings stems from the nodes’ highly effective dampening features and the algorithm’s non-parametric, multivariate, and non-linear characteristics that operate despite high rates of random noise. Thus, it will be possible for grid operators to continuously detect and isolate faults in urban gas networks in an economically feasible manner. The broader impact will be an increase in urban gas grid safety, and at least a 50% reduction in respective grid maintenance costs. For THE Systems, TM Field Analyzer could generate up to 70 mEUR by year 5 after the product launch, and increase the number of staff by at least 70 employees.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/651414", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "194723", "euroscivoc": "[\"/engineering and technology/environmental engineering/energy and fuels/fossil energy/gas\", \"/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/signal processing\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DRS-17-2014-1", "topicName": "SME instrument topic: “Protection of urban soft targets and urban critical infrastructures”", "payments": 1.0, "beneficiaries": 1.0, "amount": 50000.0, "startDate": "2014-10-01", "endDate": "2015-02-28"}, {"id": 1102.0, "name": "TOXI-triage - INTEGRATED AND ADAPTIVE RESPONSES TO TOXIC EMERGENCIES FOR RAPID TRIAGE:                   ENGINEERING THE ROADMAP FROM CASUALTY TO PATIENT TO SURVIVOR.", "programme": "Horizon 2020", "description": "The seven specific objectives of TOXI-triage address the operational; technological; ethical and societal dimensions of CBRN response and recovery, and importantly the economic base from which sustainable CBRN and multi-use systems are derived.\n19 partners in 4 Task forces will deliver 9 Work Packages (WPs) that address: end user specifications; Design and delivery; Test and Validation; and, Impact.

At the same time, TYPES will make it easier to verify whether users’ online rights are respected and if personal data is exchanged for a reasonable value-added to users.", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653449", "proof": "3.2aa1cfb0d00c643e9a1ba6166d8cfc2846022885", "recordId": "194867", "euroscivoc": "[\"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software\", \"/social sciences/economics and business\", \"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/employment\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/internet\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgramme": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security: Cybersecurity, Privacy and Trust", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DS-01-2014", "topicName": "Privacy", "payments": 10.0, "beneficiaries": 10.0, "amount": 3992663.0, "startDate": "2015-05-01", "endDate": "2017-10-31"}, {"id": 1113.0, "name": "Technical control of the sea ​​border", "programme": "Internal Security Fund", "description": "Continue to modernize maritime surveillance radars and peripherals .

In 2000 41 significant attacks on aid workers were recorded across the globe. By 2014, that number had risen to 190. In this 15-year period, over 3,000 aid workers have been killed, injured or kidnapped. Despite the increasing availability of tracking and monitoring technologies, the number of humanitarian workers that fall victim to attacks continues to rise. Clearly, a novel and innovative approach to tracking and decision-making is needed.  \nInformation systems for fleet management, GPS for navigation and location or RFID tags for inventory management are just a few of the technologies that have changed the humanitarian operations. Until now, however, there is no integrated decision support system that provides real-time analyses from the data streams that are generated by these technologies.  This lack of integrated real-time information prevents an understanding of potentially threatening situations, increases response times and creates insecure communications, all leading to inadequate protection and hampered efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe aim of better protection and more efficient and effective operations can only be achieved by devel-oping technologies along with the policies for their use. GPS, for example, notwithstanding its capability to provide live tracking of vehicles for recovery, cannot prevent an ambush or kidnapping. Technologies therefore need to go hand in hand with procedures and policies in order to provide useful early warnings to decision-makers on the ground as well as decision support for scheduling, navigation, risk management and coordination.
