Their use in Search and Rescue operations can now be envisaged to enhance first responder capabilities and intervene in hazardous areas. For cost and procedural reasons however, the market is still very fragmented and business models are unclear.\nThe DARIUS project will leverage previous R&D efforts on technologies and possible added-value of these systems for situation awareness to envisage their adaptation and integration in complex multi-national/agency SAR operations. The main objective of DARIUS is to reach effective levels of interoperability so these systems can be shared between several organisations. This objective will be achieved in designing a Generic Ground Station with associated proposed standards, a full integration in the command and control cycle and a consistent communication network. In addition, DARIUS will adapt the existing unmanned systems and their payloads (air, ground and maritime) to the specificities of the Search and Rescue missions. DARIUS solutions will be evaluated in real conditions through 3 scenarios (Urban, forest fires and maritime SAR) designed by the end-users.\nThe project will be implemented under the control of a wide panel of fully committed end-users. It will be performed following an optimised structure and with flexible and proven procedures.\nThe DARIUS consortium encompasses several end-users, major players in the domain of C4I and large system integration, unmanned system solution providers, SMEs that will bring innovative solutions and support the integration and RTOs that will further develop novel technologies.\nThe expected impact from DARIUS is the better integration of the systems in real operations and in enhancing the safety of citizens.

If the perpetrator’s objectives can be met solely through the creation of human illness, death and associated panic, this may be appropriate. However, if economic and political vulnerabilities are included as contributing factors, agricultural bioterrorism must be considered among other possible avenues of attack.\nAgricultural bioterrorism (agroterrorism) is a subset of bioterrorism, and it is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease/pest with the goal of generating fear, causing economic losses, and/or undermining stability.\nProgrammes preparing for attacks against agriculture are not new, and have been conducted both by nation-states and by substate organizations throughout history. At least nine countries (Canada, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, USA and the former USSR) had documented agricultural bioweapons programmes during some part of the 20th century. Four other countries (Egypt, North Korea, Rhodesia and Syria) are believed to have or have had agricultural bioweapons programmes.\nIn the mean time, natural outbreaks of diseases demonstrate the destructive potential of an agroterroristic attack.\nRecent trends in biosecurity recommend a shift from a largely national approach to biosecurity towards greater international cooperation. Current capabilities to detect and respond to agroterrorism are limited and spread among many organizations, with a corresponding lack of coordination.\nThe project deals with threats which are multifaceted, interrelated, complex and increasingly transnational in their impact.

This information will enable improved control and management, resulting in real time synchronization between forces on the ground (police, rescue, firefighters) and out-of-theater command and control centers (CC). The approach guiding the E-SPONDER project is based on the fusion of variable forms of field-derived data within a central system which will then provide information analysis and decision support applications at designated CC locations in order to provide in situ support to first responders that operate in Critical Infrastructures. Statistics show that efficient emergency system can reduce accident losses to 6%, compared with situations without emergency system . As a result, an efficient emergency system is a key to cope with all kinds of sudden events and improve safety of cities and countries. To do this, E-SPONDER will achieve the following objectives: i) Improvement of front end data collection technologies installed both on portable and fixed platforms, providing a flexible yet comprehensive coverage of the affected area; ii) this data will then be fused and analyzed to provide real-time decision support; iii) E-SPONDER will make these resources readily available to commanders through the use of easily accessible web-portals but lastly and most important it will provide significant support based on Information and Communication Technologies to the First Responders.

It will detect a range of substances, including but not limited to people, drugs, explosives (including weapons) and CBRNe. The technology will complement trained sniffer dogs.  The technology proposed is based on linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry (MS). MS techniques have been increasingly deployed in security sniffing applications in the USA. MS is a non-intrusive high-resolution technique able to detect single atoms and complex molecules through their charged species (ions) or fragmentation pattern. The technique is capable of detecting a wide range of substances rapidly, with high accuracy and with a stand-off capability – critically it is able to detect trace levels below parts per million. Once the MS fingerprint of a unknown substance is measured it can be compared online with a database of known substances enabling real-time rapid identification. Sniffles will develop a LIT MS based device with a larger mass range than other comparable MS techniques. Methods for miniaturisation and modularisation will be applied to allow reduced vacuum demand and upgradeability. Miniaturisation will be made possible through improved designs based on results from modelling, novel manufacturing techniques and improvements in the MS drive electronics and vacuum system. These advances will bring benefits including reduced acquisition/operating costs, greater mobility, user friendliness and flexibility.

On the thematic axis it will study four fields of knowledge of high relevance to the question of the ethics and the value-laden tensions arising along the continuum between internal and external security in Europe: (1) the ethical consequences of the proliferation of security technologies, (2) the legal dilemmas that arise from transnational security arrangements, (3) the ethical and value questions that stem from the shifting role of security professionals and (4) the consequences of the changing role of foreign security policy in an era when the distinction between the external and internal borders grows less distinct On the geopolitical axis it will study and produce recommendations relative to two geographical theatres of high relevance for ethical issues of internal/external security: the Eastern European ‘neighbourhood’ including Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and the Mediterranean ‘neighbourhood’ including Morocco, Algeria and Egypt. The project will link directly with representatives of the security technology industry as well as security provision services that implement concretely to the border security arrangements. The state-of-the-art research carried out by the project will result in a variety of different outputs aimed primarily at relevant policy-makers, researchers and educators. It will present analyses of current security challenges with particular attention to the human side of the security challenge, and on this basis propose remedial to the new challenges of the internal/external security continuum.", "startDate": "2008-04-01", "endDate": "2011-03-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "218265", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2007\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2007-1\", \"callName\": \"Security and society\", \"callArea\": \"Ethics and justice\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2007-6.5-02\", \"topicName\": \"Ethical implications of the continuum of internal and external security\", \"tags\": [\"Borders\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/218265", "beneficiaries": 9.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2007", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2007-1", "callName": "Security and society", "callArea": "Ethics and justice", "topicCode": "SEC-2007-6.5-02", "topicName": "Ethical implications of the continuum of internal and external security", "tags": "[\"Borders\"]"}, {"id": 33.0, "foreign_id": "feb334dd760a95fb5b76ee8564a1ed623e281f3f", "name": "FORLAB - Forensic Laboratory for in-situ evidence analysis in a post blast scenario", "amount": 3087446.18, "description": "'An improvised explosive device (IED) post-blast scenario is a vast area where massive and diverse evidences must be searched, collected and transferred for analysis to a distant reference laboratory.

The BASYLIS project aims to address these issues by developing a low-cost smart sensing platform that can automatically and effectively detect a range of security threats in complex environments. The principal obstacles to early threat detection in wide areas are of two types: functional (e.g. false-alarm rate) and ethical (e.g. privacy). Both problems are amplified when installations are dynamic or located in changing environments.

These new analysts will be able to project new operational plans in advance by simulating “what-if” cases in complex scenarios, and anticipating threats.\n\nThe Consortium is an outstanding example of multi-sector collaboration between research excellence institutions, large corporation, end user and SMEs from five European Countries. Three SMEs are involved, one large corporation, one University and an end-user (Spanish National Police). All of them play a relevant role in the project.

Create an open,  standards based interoperability layer that will allow: • Full (voice and data) communication interoperability between all FR teams, their command posts and the CI site control centre • Full interoperability of FR applications in use by the FR teams B. Provide practical and useful novel applications for FR teams, all integrated within the open interoperability layer: • Thermal imaging applications • Video annotation  • Advanced fibre optic sensors • Indoor navigation system Both the communications interoperability layer and the FR applications in INFRA are novel and go well beyond the current state of the art for the technology in use by FR teams.

While FP7 MICIE project has proved that increasing cooperation among infrastructures increases their level of service and predictive capability, it is not enough to effectively counteract threats such as cyber attacks. Such attacks could be performed blocking communication from central SCADA to local equipments or inserting fake commands/measurements in the SCADA-field equipment communications (as happened with STUXNET worm). The paradox is that critical infrastructures massively rely on the newest interconnected (and vulnerable) ICT technologies, while the control equipment is typically old, legacy software/hardware. Such a combination of factors may lead to very dangerous situations, exposing systems to a wide variety of attacks. To overcome such threats, the CockpitCI project aims on one hand to continue the work done in MICIE by refining and updating the on-line Risk Predictor deployed in the SCADA centre, on the other hand to provide some kind of intelligence to field equipment, allowing them to perform local decisions in order to self-identify and self-react to abnormal situations induced by cyber attacks. It is mandatory to operate both at SCADA control centre and at field equipment because it is very dangerous to let field components operate autonomously. To address this issue an hybrid validation system will be implemented: at the Control Centre level an “Integrated On-line Risk Predictor” will provide the operator with qualitative/quantitative measurements of near future level of risk integrating data coming from the field, from other infrastructures, and from smart detection agents monitoring possible cyber attacks; at field level, the system is complemented with a smart software layer for field equipment and a detection system for the TLC network.

Automated processes for DNA analysis of large numbers of samples are now used in many of the EU member states; however the most efficient of these high throughput systems can take 3-5 days to produce DNA database-compliant profiles. In high profile crime and terrorism cases it is crucial to access DNA results promptly to provide intelligence to investigators. Currently a small number of samples can be processed in less than 24 h but the method is labour intensive and expensive. MiDAS proposes a real-time, simple-to-operate and cost effective alternative. MiDAS will build on the current expertise of the consortium to deliver a robust, reliable instrument adaptable to the needs of multiple EU agencies. The design will allow processing of small numbers of samples at the scene of a crime, in an office environment or in the laboratory. Samples will be directly introduced to the device; no further manual involvement will be required. DNA will be extracted using magnetic bead technology and transferred to reaction chambers for quantification and amplification which will be controlled to normalise the DNA profile. The profile will be visualised following analysis through on-cartridge DNA separation and laser induced fluorescence–based detection. Automated data analysis using expert systems will facilitate the timely delivery of a profile. The requirements for implementation of the instrument into the forensic process will be determined, including an evaluation of relevant legislative and data protection requirements.

IDetecT 4ALL goal is to develop an innovative, Optical Intruder Sensing and Authentication Technology, that will dramatically improve the Cost/Performance ratio of security systems, thus becoming an enabler for the widespread availability of reliable and affordable security, leading to more CIs being protected. iDetecT 4ALL proposes to develop a novel Photonic Sensing technology based on an innovative approach utilizing ultra low cost electro-optical components. This novel approach enables to detect and Authenticate objects by a single sensor. The suggested concept is based on illuminating the protected area with invisible, modulated light, and by using a solid state scanning and detecting technique, to continuously monitor the 3D surface profile within the protected area.  Presence and location of intruders will be detected from the variations inflicted on this 3D profile. By integrating additional novel optical ID tagging techniques onto authorized objects (personnel, vehicles and goods) the sensing technology will also be able to reliably identify, authenticate and alert real threats introduced by unauthorized intruders into restricted areas. This innovative approach is enabled by a recently invented efficient digital signal processing (DSP) technique enabling range measurement using continuous modulated invisible (or visible) light signals and requires far less peak power than Laser scanning technologies.

The key innovation is a positive detection lateral-flow test for small molecules that is highly sensitive and simple to use making it ideally suited to deployment by First Responders at crime scenes and terrorist incidents. Lateral flow immunodiagnostics has long offered the promise of fast, high quality testing for substances of low molecular weight. There have however been very real challenges to bringing the full power of such technology to bear in this area. The problem is simply size. Large analytes can support the simultaneous binding of both capture and detector antibodies, allowing typical excess-reagent sandwich immunoassays to be formatted in which increasing analyte concentration provides an increase of observable signal over a very low zero background. Small molecules are simply not large enough to support such simultaneous binding. Alternative systems in effect measure how much analyte is not present. This causes major problems in terms of precision, sensitivity and read-out where, classically, increasing concentration of analyte reduces the signal produced, making point-of-need devices often difficult to read. What is required is a robust system in which there is no observable signal in the absence of analyte, and even low level samples give an obvious observable signal over this zero background. SALIANT offers a system based on a small bindable moiety that is first conjugated close to the binding site of a primary antibody against the analyte such that when analyte binds the antibody, the moiety can still be bound by a labelled secondary antibody. A large reagent-analogue of the analyte is also introduced, binding analyte-unbound primary antibody, and thereby blocking binding of the secondary antibody to the moiety.

The BOOSTER project addresses this requirement under Security Topic SEC-2009-4.3.2 – Bio-dosimetric tools to manage radiological casualties. Current biodosimetric approaches frequently involve cytogenetics. The analysis of dicentric/ ring chromosomes is the mechanism of choice for precise estimation of an individual’s exposure. Current optimisation of such analyses involves the automation of various steps in the process. However, chromosome analyses are performed on the first mitosis post-exposure and thus a significant limiting factor remains a cell culture step (2 days) that is impossible to reduce. New biodosimeters are required that may not bring the same precision as cytogenetic analysis but will permit triage in the first hours post-accident into three populations (i.e. to identify individuals that require no further intervention, those who require close follow-up and those who require hospitalisation). BOOSTER is a capability project designed to research and develop new bio-dosimetric tools in order to quickly evaluate the level of potential casualties, determine by appropriate sensors their consequences, allow an efficient triage of exposed people, integrate a useful and usable toolbox, train civil protection operators and define commercial exploitation potentialities. The BOOSTER project will use an integrated approach to deliver new bio-dosimetric tools.

SAMURAI is to develop a real-time adaptive behaviour profiling and abnormality detection system for alarm event alert and prediction with much reduced false alarm.   *In addition to fix-positioned CCTV cameras, the SAMURAI system will also take command input from control room operators and mobile sensory input for patrolling security staff for a hybrid context-aware based abnormal behaviour recognition. This is in contrary to current video behaviour recognition system that relies purely on information extracted from the video data, often too ambiguous to be effective. SAMURAI has the following scientific objectives: 1. Develop innovative tools and systems for people, vehicle and luggage detection, tracking, type categorisation across a network of cameras under real world conditions. 2. Develop an abnormal behaviour detection system based on a heterogeneous sensor network consisting of both fix-positioned CCTV cameras and mobile wearable cameras with audio and positioning sensors.

The increase of criminal activity is manifested in an increased frequency of small crimes like graffiti, theft, robbery, destruction of rubbish bins. This has had a big impact for local governments, citizens and businesses.\nLocal government agencies are trying to solve these problems. As was shown in New York, a reduction in petty crimes increases the sense of public order which produces further reduction in crime in general. These organizations often treat the problem with classical solutions such as increase in police resources, reintegration of offenders, rehabilitation of degraded areas and modern solutions such as urban video surveillance. However, these new technologies are often underused and inadequate.\nThe SmartPrevent project aims to enhance detection and prevention of crimes in local urban areas by exploiting the full potential of video-surveillance systems.

Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.\n\n\n\nThe project ‘Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions’ (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas. By examining 8 urban areas throughout Europe, BESECURE will build a comprehensive and pragmatic set of indicators, and a pragmatic risk assessment model that can provide cues about the development of certain scenarios. BESECURE will improve urban security policy making by sharing best practices that are in use throughout Europe, and by providing visualisation and assessment tools and guidelines that will help local policy makers to assess the impact of their practices, and improve their decision making.", "startDate": "2012-04-01", "endDate": "2015-03-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "285222", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2011\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2011-1\", \"callName\": \"Security and society\", \"callArea\": \"Organisational structure and cultures of public users\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2011.6.2-1\", \"topicName\": \"Best practices for enhancing security policy in urban zones\", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285222", "beneficiaries": 15.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2011", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2011-1", "callName": "Security and society", "callArea": "Organisational structure and cultures of public users", "topicCode": "SEC-2011.6.2-1", "topicName": "Best practices for enhancing security policy in urban zones", "tags": null}, {"id": 135.0, "foreign_id": "85d381b6702fd53ea4c4ed96e771632c4032aa7a", "name": "CPSI - Changing Perceptions of Security and Interventions", "amount": 2165637.0, "description": "The goal of the present project is to provide governments and related organizations with a methodology to increase insight into the determinants of actual and perceived security, and into which interventions are effective for increasing security.

The concept and objectives of the LOTUS project are to create a system by which illicit production of explosives and drugs can be detected during the preparation and production phase of a terrorist plot. LOTUS provides intelligence of a sort that is otherwise not available. This intelligence covers a gap where little information is available from other sources. Detection in this phase has advantages compared to detection of the explosives themselves during e.g. the transportation phase. The LOTUS project main activities are measurement of the dispersion of pre-cursors at production and surveillance system development. The system capability will be demonstrated by adapting existing and emerging sensors for detection of selected precursors, and integrating the sensors in a networked system. By using existing global infrastructures for positioning (GPS) and networking (GSM) the LOTUS system can be used more or less anywhere in the world with small costs for supporting installations and personnel. The final outcome of the LOTUS project is a field test and demonstration. The demonstration system will be based on mobile sensors (3-5) mounted in law enforcement vehicles.

The probability of exposure to EWE is expected to increase, both in frequency and intensity. Obviously, there is a need to build anticipatory adaptation and organizational resilience to these relatively unforeseen and unexpected EWE impacts on CI.\n\nHence, allowing for future EWE in the design and operational parameters of new and current CI is of fundamental and pressing strategic importance, to ensure cost effective fit, for purpose CI over the lifetime of the assets. There is an obligation to revisit the risk posed to new and existing CI and to develop practical (evidence based) responses by risk-based techniques and a set of validated tools and data sets tailored to practical needs reflecting the level of the risk and the severity of impact (social, economic, environmental, etc.) that would result in CI failure due to EWE.\n\nINTACT recognizes that a European-wide coordinated and cooperative effort is required.

In recent decades, the number of threats to aviation security has grown significantly, especially after 9/11. This has led to ever more security regulations as the threats evolve. Security procedures have become exceedingly complex and invasive to passenger privacy; the number of security measures as well as personnel and therefore costs are growing steadily.\nAt the same time passenger and cargo traffic are expected to double in the next 15 years. Already today, security is one of the main reasons for delayed take-off. It is clear that the current complex security system cannot be adapted to such a growth without a large rise in costs. It has already and will increasingly become a major market restraint.\nTherefore, the proposed project COPRA aims to answer two questions:\n•\tHow does the threat situation in civil aviation evolve in the future, taking into account both existing and new technologies and their continuing development and proliferation?\n•\tWhich opportunities arise from the development and proliferation of new technologies and security procedures to overcome the current complex and expensive security situation and to enable sustainable growth for the future?\nCOPRA’s main objective is to answer both questions in a way that will constitute the optimal balance between security, privacy, public acceptability, mobility and costs, while providing ideas on how to increase flexibility and resilience of the whole aviation system against threats.\nTo that aim COPRA brings together a well balanced consortium of research organisations, industry and major air transport providers with a wide range of European stakeholders.

Current automatic detection systems have limited functionality, struggling to make inferences about the acceptability of human behaviour. ADABTS aims to address one of the key problems, the definition of abnormal behaviour, by extracting characterizations in realistic security settings based on expert classifications and the analysis of CCTV operator behaviour. A set of behaviour descriptors will be defined and models of threatening behaviour will be built.   Algorithms will be developed that detect pre-defined threat behaviours and deviations from normal behaviour. For accurate and robust detection, data from audio and video sensors will be combined with context information. The trade-off between system generality and capability is addressed by extracting a set of intermediate-level behaviour descriptors that are observable from sensor data. This makes the system configurable to specific needs and improves scalability and cost efficiency. A real-time evaluation platform will be developed based on commercial heterogeneous hardware. Such hardware, in rapid development driven by the video game industry, represents a huge potential for high-performance low-cost surveillance systems. The evaluation platform will demonstrate pro-active detection of potential threats.

There is strong need to protect people, the societal community and critical infrastructures and utilities against being damaged, destroyed or disrupted by deliberate acts of terrorism. Solutions have to be derived to realize sufficient resilience of the urban infrastructure for rare occasions with minimum effect on normality. Hitherto, normal regulations and building guidelines do not take into account the CBRE threat. Fortunately, the required specialist knowledge is available on explosion dynamics, response of structures, dispersions of toxic agents and the injuries. This knowledge should be explored to derive the required solutions. Therefore, the SPIRIT Consortium was formed to bring the required expertise together, make these commonly available and to find solutions that can be integrated into normal life and planning and building procedures. Within SPIRIT a terrorist attack with the whole scope of CBRE-threat is addressed. The main outcome of the project is an integrated approach to counter CBRE-threats, including proposed guidelines for a EU Regulatory Framework. With this approach, government, end users of buildings and designers can define and achieve a desired level of protection. The SPIRIT contribution to built infrastructure protection will be: - A methodology to quantify the vulnerability of built infra in damage, number of injuries and loss of functionality and services; - A guidance tool to assess the vulnerability and define efficient and effective countermeasures to achieve a required protection level; - Draft guidelines to enable safety based engineering and the incorporation of CBRE protection; - A suite of ready to use CBRE countermeasure products.

In addition, from a technical perspective, the consolidation of current EMS and the limitations of their exchanged data formats offers another problem to be solved in any solution proposed for information interoperability between heterogeneous EMS surrounded by different contexts.\nTo overcome this problem, a two step solution is proposed: (i) As main objective and foundations of this proposal, the development of a common and modular ontology shared by all the stakeholders offers the best solution to gather all stakeholders knowledge in a unique and flexible data model, taking into account different countries cultural, linguistic and legal issues (ii) Taking advantage of  the fact that most legacy Emergency Management Systems are based on Service-Oriented-Architectures (SOA), i.e. they collect information from services offered by other systems (e.g. Geographic Information Systems), the interoperability burden will be addressed by means of transparent SOA mediation algorithms compliant with current data formats and existing solutions.\nTaking into account the heterogeneity and diversity of all existing scenarios in crisis episodes, the potential results of this proposed ontology-based interoperability solution will be validated through the design and development of a realistic prototype scenario actively involving both emergency managers and emergency first responders.", "startDate": "2012-02-01", "endDate": "2015-01-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "285069", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/humanities/philosophy, ethics and religion/philosophy/metaphysics/ontology\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\", \"/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/physical geography/cartography/geographic information systems\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2011\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2011-1\", \"callName\": \"Improving security systems integration, interconnectivity and interoperability\", \"callArea\": \"Interoperability\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2011.5.3-2\", \"topicName\": \"Operational data exchange\", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/285069", "beneficiaries": 7.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/humanities/philosophy, ethics and religion/philosophy/metaphysics/ontology\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\", \"/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/physical geography/cartography/geographic information systems\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2011", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2011-1", "callName": "Improving security systems integration, interconnectivity and interoperability", "callArea": "Interoperability", "topicCode": "SEC-2011.5.3-2", "topicName": "Operational data exchange", "tags": null}, {"id": 187.0, "foreign_id": "8b006f0376bf2014e60b09cb32c6afe77321d818", "name": "NI2S3 - NET INFORMATION INTEGRATION SERVICES FOR SECURITY SYSTEMS", "amount": 2711640.0, "description": "The key idea of proposed project is to research and implement a reference methodology for developing security systems based on NEC Information and Integration Services, able to integrate information from many and heterogeneous sources, in order to build up or improve the situation awareness of critical infrastructures.

E-CRIME addresses these well-known problems, while analysing the economic impact of cyber crime and developing concrete measures to manage risks and deter cyber criminals in non-ICT sectors. E-CRIME does so by adopting an interdisciplinary and multi-level-stakeholder focused approach that fully integrates a wide range of stakeholders’ knowledge and insights into the project. First, the project will create a detailed taxonomy and inventory of cyber crime in non-ICT sectors and analyse cyber criminal structures and economies by combining the best existing data sources with specialist new insights from key stakeholders and experts. Second, E-CRIME will assess existing counter-measures against cyber crime in non-ICT sectors in the form of current technology, best practices, policy and enforcement approaches, and awareness and trust initiatives. Third, having mapped the as-is of cyber crime, the project will use available information and new data to develop a multi-level model to measure the economic impact of cyber crime on non ICT-sectors. Fourth, E-CRIME will integrate all its previous findings to identify and develop diverse, concrete counter-measures, combined in portfolios of inter-sector and intra-sector solutions, including enhancement for crime-proofed applications, risk management tools, policy and best practices, and trust and confidence measures.

These methods differ in their specificity and sensitivity to radiation, the stability of signal and speed of performance. A large scale radiological emergency can take different forms. Based on the emergency scenario different biodosimetric tools should be applied so that the dosimetric information can be made available with optimal speed and precision. The aim of this multi-disciplinary collaborative project is to analyse a variety of biodosimetric tools and adapt them to different mass casualty scenarios. The following biodosimetric tools will be validated and established: the dicentric assay, the micronucleus assay, the gamma-H2AX assay, the skin speckle assay, the blood serum protein expression assay and EPR/OSL dosimetry in components of pocket electronic devises. The assays were chosen because they complement each other with respect to sensitivity, specificity to radiation and the exposure scenario as well as speed of performance. The project will involve the key European players with extensive experience in biological dosimetry. Training will be carried out and automation and commercialisation pursued. An operational guide will be developed and disseminated among emergency preparedness and radiation protection organisations.

This is a problem since as societies become more complex, increasing scope and unpredictability of potential crises and faster dynamics of major incidents put increasingly stringent demands on CM. European CM capabilities already constitute a mature System of Systems; hence wholesale redesign would often be too costly and might critically destabilise existing CM capabilities. Therefore DRIVER\\ focuses on augmenting rather than replacing existing capabilities. DRIVER\\ has three main objectives: 1) Develop a pan-European Test-bed for crisis management capability development; 2) Develop a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of crisis management solutions, and 3) Facilitate a shared understanding of crisis management across Europe.\n\nThe DRIVER\\ Test-bed will provide the technological infrastructure, the necessary supporting methodology and adequate support tools. The Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) is a database driven web site that documents all the available DRIVER\\ solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the trials. Initially, the PoS will contain information about the solutions that are already available within the consortium; the PoS will be extended with third-party solutions when required by the trials, and ultimately opened up for any external organisation to share data and experiences on solutions.\n\nA series of trials will be conducted during which solutions will be operationalised and tested. All results of the trials will be stored and made available in the PoS. Several I4CM events will be organized as well as a final conference. In addition to this, a firm link is established and will be maintained with DG HOME’s “Community of Users on Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies” and other European stakeholder groups and relevant initiatives, for instance on standardization.\n\nTo maximise impact beyond the scope of the project and of the DRIVER\\ consortium it is necessary to develop the sustainability of the European Test-bed, the exploitation of the DRIVER Portfolio of Solutions and to promote a European CM community, which shares a common CM understanding and is increasingly willing to share capabilities and collaborate in CM innovation. Together this will boost Europe’s ability to continue adapting to new threats and emerging needs, laying the basis for a continuously resilient EU and providing a mechanism to drive innovation in European CM by bridging the gap from practitioners need and R&D to the market.", "startDate": "2014-05-01", "endDate": "2020-04-30", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "607798", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management\", \"/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2013\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2013-1\", \"callName\": \"Restoring security and safety in case of crisis\", \"callArea\": \"Preparedness, prevention, mitigation and planning\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2013.4.1-1\", \"topicName\": \"Phase II demonstration programme on aftermath crisis management\", \"tags\": [\"Crisis management\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607798", "beneficiaries": 42.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/economics and business/business and management/commerce\", \"/social sciences/sociology/governance/crisis management\", \"/social sciences/other social sciences/social sciences interdisciplinary/sustainable development\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2013", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Restoring security and safety in case of crisis", "callArea": "Preparedness, prevention, mitigation and planning", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.4.1-1", "topicName": "Phase II demonstration programme on aftermath crisis management", "tags": "[\"Crisis management\"]"}, {"id": 227.0, "foreign_id": "0ae7ffacafb42e04d947dfe84898cbcbde5acbd0", "name": "SEREN 2 - SEcurity REsearch Ncp network – phase 2", "amount": 1499546.21, "description": "This proposal has been elaborated to continue the work undertaken in the former project SEcurity REsearch Ncp network – phase I (SEREN I), therefore the activities foreseen in this proposal are built upon the outcomes reached previously by the network.\nThe Security National Contact Points (NCPs) network is still at an early stage and its members were quite recently appointed as NCPs, as compared to NCPs from other Themes within FP7, therefore an enhanced communication and collaboration among the members are deemed necessary in order to further strengthen the network.\nPresently, the main tool on which potential participants in security call for proposals rely on for building balanced consortia and for writing high quality proposals is the NCP network being, and for that reason it is essential to reinforce the network’s capability to cope with issues that might arise, especially with those which have a security specific character.\nTo tackle and overcome the difficulties of building international partnerships and in order to foster the participation in the security research field, the network will organize joint brokerage events and awareness campaigns with focus on promoting good project ideas and on identifying ways and means for the end-user involvement.

B) Experimental trials will be carried out in three countries simulating real time evacuation scenarios in standardized settings including objective measures (e.g. response time) as outcomes as well as video-tape analysis. Results will be analysed to identify similarities and differences between cultures and ethnic groups as well as a range of socioeconomic factors. The analysis will triangulate findings obtained with objective measures, subjective experiences and behavioural observations.  Two types of research findings and products will be provided by the BeSeCu projects: (A) An evidence base that will enable designers of buildings to develop culturally appropriate emergency operating procedures.  (B) An evidence base of inter-individual differences that will be employed to develop a culture sensitive communication training to improve emergency interventions. The research will be carried out by a consortium of 8 European partners including end-users (e.g. fire service colleges) in the process of research.", "startDate": "2008-05-01", "endDate": "2011-12-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "218324", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2007\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2007-1\", \"callName\": \"Security and society\", \"callArea\": \"Citizens and society\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2007-6.1-02\", \"topicName\": \"Human behaviour before, during and after crisis situations to understand how people react to threat alerts and security instructions \", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/218324", "beneficiaries": 10.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2007", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2007-1", "callName": "Security and society", "callArea": "Citizens and society", "topicCode": "SEC-2007-6.1-02", "topicName": "Human behaviour before, during and after crisis situations to understand how people react to threat alerts and security instructions ", "tags": null}, {"id": 246.0, "foreign_id": "5c94272539936ca7dc27da0a8f54495e56e1d396", "name": "SESAME - Securing the European Electricity Supply Against Malicious and accidental thrEats", "amount": 2753789.76, "description": "Threats for the supply of electricity have changed dramatically throughout the last decade: additional to the natural and accidental ones, the new threat of malicious attacks needs to be considered.

Where security solutions involve the collection of information about citizens, questions arise as to whether their privacy has been infringed. This infringement of individual privacy is sometimes seen as an acceptable cost of enhanced security. Similarly, citizens are seen as willing to trade-off their privacy for enhanced personal security in different settings. These common understandings of the security-privacy relationship, both at state and citizen levels, have informed policymakers, legislative developments and best practice guidelines concerning security developments across the EU. However, an emergent body of work questions the validity of the security-privacy trade-off, suggesting that this has over-simplified the consideration of the impact and acceptability of security solutions on citizens in current security policy and practice. Thus, the more complex issues underlying privacy concerns and public scepticism towards surveillance-oriented security solutions (SOSSs) may not be apparent to legal and technological experts. In response to these developments, this project will consult with citizens from several EU member and associated states on the question of the security-privacy trade-off as they evaluate different security solutions. Through extensive preparatory work, the project will identify and empirically examine the influence of a broad range of issues upon their evaluations. Using citizen consultation meetings, questionnaires and innovative visual methods, a representative, fine-grained picture from across Europe will be provided.

However, in spite of the improvements, modern body armours still have some of the same drawbacks as the old ones, as they are mostly heavy, bulky and rigid. Therefore they limit the wearer’s mobility and agility and are impractical for use on joints, arms, legs, etc. Moreover, body armours have traditionally been designed to protect the wearer against ballistic threats and, thus, they provide only a limited level of protection against knives, sharp blades or sharp-tipped weapons. Recent studies, however, reveal that stab and puncture have become a main cause of police officers' injuries. Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop materials that combine stab and ballistic protection, while retaining their flexibility and low weight.\nIn this context, the proposed project aims to develop optimized ballistic textiles (both woven and spacer knitted fabrics) and apply innovative surface treatments (e.g. shear thickening fluids, ceramic coatings) to improve their performance on an areal density basis. Thus, fewer fabric layers will be required, which is expected to result in increased flexibility and reduced weight of the armour. Main parameters to consider also include physiological comfort and ergonomic design.\nAdditionally, smart functions, including positioning systems, will be integrated to further increase the efficiency of the body armour, eventually leading to reduced casualties.\nFinally, while a main limitation is that existing protective gear is usually limited to the body armour, innovative solutions are herein proposed for the protection of vulnerable body parts other than the torso.'", "startDate": "2014-04-01", "endDate": "2017-09-30", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "607295", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/engineering and technology/materials engineering/coating and films\", \"/engineering and technology/materials engineering/textiles\", \"/social sciences/law\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2013\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2013-1\", \"callName\": \"Security of citizens\", \"callArea\": \"Ordinary crime and forensics\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2013.1.4-1\", \"topicName\": \"Smart and protective clothing for law enforcement and first responders \\u2013 Capability Project\", \"tags\": [\"Police\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/607295", "beneficiaries": 10.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/engineering and technology/materials engineering/coating and films\", \"/engineering and technology/materials engineering/textiles\", \"/social sciences/law\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2013", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2013-1", "callName": "Security of citizens", "callArea": "Ordinary crime and forensics", "topicCode": "SEC-2013.1.4-1", "topicName": "Smart and protective clothing for law enforcement and first responders – Capability Project", "tags": "[\"Police\"]"}, {"id": 255.0, "foreign_id": "23c5b17073294e28e7d7f1ab3ae00a45c57b4a46", "name": "TRACE - TRafficking as A Criminal Enterprise", "amount": 1006492.37, "description": "TRafficking as A Criminal Enterprise (TRACE) aims to support stakeholders in combating and disrupting human trafficking, one of the largest criminal enterprises in the world, by assessing and consolidating information surrounding the perpetrators and the wider trafficking enterprise.

Yet new EU regulations and specifically those on information sharing between police and security forces explicitly prohibit automated decision-taking regarding individuals unless “authorised by a law which also lays down measures to safeguard the data subject’s legitimate interests” (art 7, CFD 2008/977/JHA). Where are these laws, what can these measures be and what else should the laws contain? Can the laws be technology-neutral but sector specific, thus permitting a measured approach to the appropriateness of smart surveillance technologies in key security applications? Can they be extended to all security applications of smart surveillance, even those not covered by CFD 2008/977/JHA or the proposed directive set to replace it? This project (SMART) addresses these and other questions through a comprehensive approach which combines a technical review of key application areas by sector with a review of existing pertinent legislation to  then produce a set of guidelines and a model law compliant with CFD 2008/977/JHA and EU Directive 46/95 and the proposed successor legislation. The project first focuses on one meaning of “measures” i.e. it uses expertise from police and security forces from inside and outside the EU to “measure” (as in “calculate”) risk factors in a number of priority application areas for smart surveillance technologies including border control, crowd-control, counter-terrorism and e-government. Bringing together some of Europe’s leading experts on data protection with senior police officers responsible for using surveillance in the most CCTV-intensive cities in the world, SMART evaluates the appropriateness and available safeguards for on-line surveillance and associated risks inherent in data-sharing and exchange. Having thus identified appropriate instances of application as well as a number of technical, procedural and legal options for safeguards, the project moves on to create a tool-kit which would be useful to system designers, policy makers and legislative draughtsmen across Europe (and hopefully beyond). At this stage the project turns to a second meaning of “measures” i.e. it would bring to bear significant EU-wide expertise in data protection legislation in order to prepare a draft model law which would contain a number of measures providing adequate safeguards for the data subject and thus rendering use of smart surveillance compliant with CFD 2008/977/JHA and its proposed successor and other applicable regulations.", "startDate": "2011-06-01", "endDate": "2014-05-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "261727", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/social sciences/law\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2010\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2010-1\", \"callName\": \"Security and society\", \"callArea\": \"Ethics and justice\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2010.6.5-2\", \"topicName\": \"Use of smart surveillance systems, data protection, integrity and sharing information within privacy rules\", \"tags\": [\"Surveillance\", \"Police\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/261727", "beneficiaries": 20.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/law\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2010", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2010-1", "callName": "Security and society", "callArea": "Ethics and justice", "topicCode": "SEC-2010.6.5-2", "topicName": "Use of smart surveillance systems, data protection, integrity and sharing information within privacy rules", "tags": "[\"Surveillance\", \"Police\"]"}, {"id": 263.0, "foreign_id": "18f018f2efce9abeeca91f24a0d89b3d3d57d92d", "name": "CUSTOM - Drugs and Precursor Sensing by Complementing Low Cost Multiple Techniques", "amount": 3486406.0, "description": "A large number of techniques have been developed in the latest decades, which are able to screen and identify specific molecules for drug precursors detection even at very low concentration in lab testing.Nevertheless the objective to build up a system which proves to be easy to use, compact, able to provide screening over a large number of compounds and discriminate them with low false alarm (FA) and high probability of detection (POD) is still an open issue.The project will focus on employing multiple techniques, integrating them in a complex system which employs them in a complimentary approach in order to identify an optimum trade-off between opposite requirements: compactness, simplicity, low cost vs. sensitivity low false alarm rate, selectivity. Known techniques, as fluorescence will be improved by mean of novel proteins, as antibodies to extend Probability of Detection (PoD). The techniques are: 1. A low cost, high data throughput sensing technique, based on UV-Vis-NIR fluorescence. Fluorescence will be enhanced by development of Organic macro-molecules sensitive to specific classes of compounds of interest (ephedrine, pseudoephedryne, P2P, …) in the domain of drug detection. The fluorescence analysis will be based on an ‘opto-chip’ which can incorporate an array of different properly engineered fluorescent chemical protein able to bind to the analytes with an ‘immuno-type’ reaction. An array of classes of compounds can be thus very fast discriminated by one-shot measurement. 2.

The underlying idea of ORIGINS is to improve the security and therefore to restore the confidence in the application process and issuance of e-passports, by filling the gaps in security of breeder documents. Indeed, while some assurance approaches have been implemented in a few countries, they remain insufficient to provide breeder documents in complete security and trustworthiness at a time when this is increasingly necessary.\nThis project will therefore investigate exhaustively the current state of passport breeder documents requirements and issuing practices in Member States/Associated Countries. The identification of common security gaps will lead to the recommendation of possible solutions to overcome the security weaknesses in breeder documents. The project will provide support for issuance bodies and border control communities. It will also promote the standardisation of breeder documents by creating a dedicated working group at a European level.\nThese objectives will be achieved through the establishment of a strong networking environment between key actors in the sector (passport breeder document and e-passport communities, border control community, ministries, industry, SMEs, universities, NGOs, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, …), exchange and dissemination of good practices between relevant communities, the definition and organisation of joint or common initiatives, meetings, conferences, events and with an appropriate management of the action.

In last years a not correct management of emergencies often created critical situations. In the happening of a catastrophic event, it is human behaviour-- and often human behaviour alone--that determines the speed and efficacy of the crisis management efforts. Frequently speed and efficacy do not stem from the ignorance of procedures, but from the difficulty to operate in contexts where consistent damages are occurring, for the difficulty of managing emotional aspects. Training plays an important function to the preparation of the crisis manager. Currently two main modalities for training purpose are two: table top exercise and real world simulation exercise. Table top exercises are low cost and can be easily and frequently organized, but it cannot recreate the real atmosphere, (e.g. stress, confusion) and need to keep critical decisions in very little time. On the other hand, crisis managers trained through simulation exercises on the field can be very effective, but such a simulations are very expensive and cannot be easily and quickly organized. PANDORA will bridge the gap between table-top exercises and real world simulation exercises, providing a near-real training environment at affordable cost. In a real-time, physics-based environment, PANDORA authentically simulates all the dynamic elements of the entire disaster environment. PANDORA will emulate a complete crisis room: realistic 3D visuals and audio create a truly immersive, chaotic and stressful environment. PANDORA realistically responds to actions taken to enable real individual training value and the development of complete skill sets.

To secure a government building against multiple threats while maintaining a minimal level of transparency and accessibility requires an integral security approach. It demands interdisciplinary collaboration between different experts from different domains. Currently, there is no efficient method or tool that allows the experts of different stripes to efficiently design, evaluate and implement appropriate security concepts. Existing ones do not allow for the effective creation, analysis, assessment, and sharing of security concepts that will help government administrators provide a secure environment for personnel and citizens.\n\nThe VASCO project addresses two important objectives. First, it will design, implement and evaluate an innovative IT tool that will enable security professionals and administrators to jointly formulate, test, and adjust security concepts and measures in a virtual environment. This provides a cost-effective and risk-free environment in which to devise an evidence-based, all-risk approach for the protection of government buildings. Second, it will produce a knowledge and best practice database, which captures dynamic and visual reference scenarios created with the VASCO system.\n\nTo accomplish these aims, the project will adopt an iterative methodology that enables the constant involvement of its world-class security and crisis management experts, assisted by a solid and open user group, during the whole project.

It is well known that, all over Europe, current first-responder networks use a large number of different and incompatible technologies therefore compromising efficient coordination of combined operations (such as cross-border or crisis management). It is also known that European organizations dealing with public-safety have invested in dedicated critical systems (to ensure high-availability and reliability). This includes dedicated networks of, among others, PMR (Professional Mobile Radio) and, more specifically, TETRA (TErrestrial Trunked RAdio). Moreover, with the fast development of communications technologies, new capabilities and opportunities are being adopted and exploited by early-adopters FRs, such as ad-hoc mesh broadband networks, able to provide and/or extend connectivity over affected areas (e.g., underground and destroyed area) and to deliver high data throughput (higher than 5Mbps)\n\nTherefore, to answer FRs needs, HIT-GATE will be developed to support a mix of technologies used today by organizations involved in Public-Safety, ranging from legacy-PMR, TETRA to next-generation networks. In this way, organizations may keep their existing systems and/or adopt novel technologies, since the proposed HIT-GATE solution is future proof and ensures communications interoperability between the networks (limited, of course, to the limitations in capabilities of each network). HIT-GATE will also enable communications across heterogeneous networks between first responders during operations.

Being one of the major trends in the IT industry recently, it has gained tremendous momentum and started to revolutionize the way enterprises create and deliver IT solutions. As more sectors adopt cloud services in their computing environment, the trend will also reach ICT services operating critical infrastructures (CI), such as transportation systems or infrastructure surveillance.\nHosting CI services in the cloud brings with it security and resilience requirements that existing cloud offerings are not well placed to address.  Due to the opacity and elasticity of cloud environ-ments, the risks of deploying CI services in the cloud are difficult to assess – specifically on the technical level, but also from legal or business perspectives. Traditional IT security measures cannot fully tackle the issues (e.g. risk, trust, and resilience) arising from this paradigm shift, especially for operators and manufacturers of CI IT systems. Therefore, the mission of the SECCRIT project is to analyse and evaluate cloud computing technologies with respect to security risks in sensitive environments, and to develop methodologies, technologies, and best practices for creating a secure, trustworthy, and high assurance cloud computing environment for CI.\nIn order to accomplish this mission, the objectives of the SECCRIT project are: identification of the relevant legal framework and establishment of respective guidelines, provision of evidence and data protection for cloud services; understanding and managing risk associated with cloud environments; understanding cloud behaviour in the face of challenges; establishment of best practice for secure cloud service implementations; and the demonstration of SECCRIT research and development results in real-world application scenarios.", "startDate": "2013-01-01", "endDate": "2015-12-31", "program": "FP7 Security", "projectId": "312758", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection\"], \"theme\": \"Security\", \"workProgram\": \"2012\", \"callId\": \"FP7-SEC-2012-1\", \"callName\": \"Increasing the Security of infrastructures and utilities\", \"callArea\": \"Cyber crime\", \"topicCode\": \"SEC-2012.2.5-2\", \"topicName\": \"Cyber resilience \\u2013 Secure cloud computing for critical infrastructure - Capability Project\", \"tags\": [\"Surveillance\", \"Critical infrastructure\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/312758", "beneficiaries": 10.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/sociology/governance/public services\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/computer security/data protection\"]", "theme": "Security", "workProgram": "2012", "callId": "FP7-SEC-2012-1", "callName": "Increasing the Security of infrastructures and utilities", "callArea": "Cyber crime", "topicCode": "SEC-2012.2.5-2", "topicName": "Cyber resilience – Secure cloud computing for critical infrastructure - Capability Project", "tags": "[\"Surveillance\", \"Critical infrastructure\"]"}, {"id": 305.0, "foreign_id": "63490fc80b7604c1d9779efd71b533d82138fc40", "name": "HYRIM - Hybrid Risk Management for Utility Networks", "amount": 3387085.0, "description": "Risk management is a core duty in critical infrastructures as operated by utility providers.

For that matter, our method will explicitly account for the infrastructure’s two-fold nature in terms of the utility network and the control network alongside it. The expected impact is thus a movement away from best practice only, towards the treatment of risk in utility networks based on a sound and well-understood mathematical foundation.

In this respect, C2-SENSE project's main objective is to develop a profile based Emergency Interoperability Framework by the use of existing standards and semantically enriched Web services to expose the functionalities of C2 Systems, Sensor Systems and other emergency/crisis management systems. This will be developed in three steps: (1) first, an Emergency Domain Inventory will be created by surveying existing standards, real life use cases of sensors, devices, C2 systems and emergency management architectures for different scenarios in security field.  (2) Based on this inventory, a common Emergency Domain Ontology will be developed to gather all stakeholders' knowledge in a unique and flexible data model. (3) Finally, by using the concepts in this ontology, by also taking into account both functional and operational requirements as well as different countries' cultural, linguistic and legal issues, Emergency Interoperability Profiles that will constitute the framework will be developed. The necessary standardization activities will be initiated to evolve C2-SENSE Emergency Interoperability Framework into a standard specification for interoperability between Sensor Systems and C2 Systems.

In theory, we know very well how we should prevent, detect and mitigate domestic violence. However in daily practice this is often not taken into account. Also, there is less research on the factors that escalate family and partner conflict into high impact domestic violence. IMPRODOVA will focus on the police side of the gap between what we know and what we do, but will also include the aspect of police co-operation with other first responders. Why, in practical police work, is domestic violence often regarded as a low priority problem? Why is the reporting rate by victims low? What are the human factors that define effective response and best practice police work in networks of other first line responders, e.g. health practitioners, schools, and youth services?\nPolice frontline responder interviews expanded by fieldwork observation data will be weighed against intermediate and top police leadership expertise collected in the partner LEA's. The influence of human factor variables in frontline operations will be investigated, and the parameters of risk assessment, also of medical practitioners, will be established and compared. Training and study materials with a special focus on scenario-based learning modules will be designed to address the barriers to better domestic violence policing. IMPRODOVA will reach out across the boundaries of first and other relevant responders by disseminating the field research findings to other professionals and representatives of domestic violence prevention and mitigation.

The image or idea of a “promised land”, however, might not be real, and newcomers are often faced with obstacles and challenges. Certain narratives and perceptions of Europe influence migration aspirations and false images can not only lead to problems when the image does not hold true, but it might also even lead to security threats, risks or radicalisation. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to understand and investigate narratives about Europe, how these can lead to problems and threats, how they are distributed, and, in a next step, find ways to react and counteract on them. Perceptions on Europe are formed in the country of residence, and they are based on a multitude of sources. Social media and new communication networks, in addition, have increased the scope and the intensity of distribution of such narratives; and furthermore, so-called filter bubbles and echo chambers can lead to isolated misperceptions that are not corrected. Due to new communication technologies, false or incorrect claims become life on their own, raise expectations or disapproval. At the same time, however, these technologies and communication networks might also provide a channel to set an exaggerated image straight and to promote a more realistic narrative.

They facilitate trustworthy trades and exchanges over the Internet, power cryptocurrencies, ensure transparency for documents, and much more.\nAlthough based on cryptographic techniques at their core, the currently deployed DLTs do not address privacy. Indeed, the very idea of a public ledger that stores a verifiable record of transactions at first appears inherently incompatible with the privacy requirements of many potential applications, which use sensitive data such as trade secrets and personal information. New cryptographic techniques and protocols are therefore needed to protect the data, facilitate these applications, and make DLTs deliver on their promises.\nPRIViLEDGE realises cryptographic protocols supporting privacy, anonymity, and efficient decentralised consensus for DLTs. In PRIViLEDGE, several European key players in cryptographic research and from the fintech and blockchain domains unite to push the limits of cryptographic protocols for privacy and security. Results from PRIViLEDGE are demonstrated through four ledger-based solutions: (1) verifiable online voting; (2) contract validation and execution for insurance; (3) university diploma record ledger; and (4) update mechanism for stake-based ledgers. The selected use cases are diverse and represent the principal application domains of DLT; this ensures wide reach and impact of the techniques developed in PRIViLEDGE beyond the immediate scope of the project.", "startDate": "2018-01-01", "endDate": "2021-06-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "780477", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"2014-15\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"Digital Security Focus Area\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"DS-06-2017\", \"topicName\": \"Cybersecurity PPP: Cryptography\", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/780477", "beneficiaries": 10.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security Focus Area", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DS-06-2017", "topicName": "Cybersecurity PPP: Cryptography", "tags": null}, {"id": 336.0, "foreign_id": "b8871b7a0552b2d55da9b2c88df3579c4a1c040d", "name": "BPR4GDPR - Business Process Re-engineering and functional toolkit for GDPR compliance", "amount": 2974012.4, "description": "The goal of BPR4GDPR is to provide a holistic framework able to support end-to-end GDPR-compliant intra- and inter-organisational ICT-enabled processes at various scales, while also being generic enough, fulfilling operational requirements covering diverse application domains.

Most academic and policy initiatives to date have focused on the direct security impacts of climate change in Third Countries and/or on the indirect impacts on international security (e.g. concerning regional economic or political stability). While those initiatives offer invaluable insights, CLISEL is based on the presumption that many indirect impacts on Europe’s security emerge and are felt at the local scale, within Europe itself. This is overlooked by most existing initiatives on the so called climate-security nexus, and the conditions under which local authorities act upon climate change (in)security within their operations are not well understood. \n\nTo fill this gap, CLISEL explores the climate-security nexus from the perspective of local administrations and communities, based on the idea that innovations in the exercise of regulatory power of local authorities can contribute to enhance the understanding of the indirect security implications of climate change in Third countries, as well as to take proactive action. In particular, CLISEL looks at the issue of climate-induced migration, an issue often cited as an indirect security dimension of climate change, from the perspective of local administrators in Sardinia. The aim is to understand the extent to which migrants from ecologically vulnerable Third Countries are perceived as a security issue, the reasons why that is (not) the case, as well as the policies and actions through which local administrators can ward off the emergence of security crisis within their territory.", "startDate": "2016-05-01", "endDate": "2019-04-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "700385", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology/climatic changes\", \"/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"2014-15\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"DRS-22-2015\", \"topicName\": \"Impact of climate change in third countries on Europe's security\", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700385", "beneficiaries": 4.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology/climatic changes\", \"/natural sciences/earth and related environmental sciences/atmospheric sciences/climatology\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Disaster-resilience: safeguarding and securing society, including adapting to climate change", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DRS-22-2015", "topicName": "Impact of climate change in third countries on Europe's security", "tags": null}, {"id": 338.0, "foreign_id": "d9245df411d4a59f8aaadb0d23ed8edbff683782", "name": "NOSY - New Operational Sensing sYstem", "amount": 4198684.63, "description": "Organized crime investigation can greatly benefit from the availability of very small, concealable sensing devices to monitor, record and communicate criminal activity to remote surveillance stations.

This makes CBRN TC the perfect operational intermediary between all civilian and military CBRN actors, EU relevant bodies and policy-makers, as well as the best cradle for expansion of a CBRN network of professionals. Main pillars for the network and confidence building will be to pool and share resources, effective practices and lessons learned, to map and label EU CBRN TC based on their capabilities and specificities, and to use a dedicated web based information and communication platform for exchanges and dissemination. Rather than usual workshops that are of no interest for task-focused, busy practitioners, the CBRN TC network will organize joint activities, training and debriefing in well-adapted infrastructures, using real-life or simulated situations (e.g., field exercises, table top, serious gaming and simulations), with external partners, in order to foster the identification of genuine users’ needs with users-driven technological solutions.

This adaptation however, was rather hasty and without thorough evaluation of its impact on security. The result was to leave CIs vulnerable to a who the new set of threats and attacks that impose high levels of risk to the public safety, economy and welfare of the population.

Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. \nThe goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes.

More specifically, we propose an integrated solution to support forecasting, early warnings, transmission and routing of the emergency data, aggregated analysis of multimodal data and management the coordination between the first responders and the authorities. Our intention is to rely on platforms, theories and methodologies that are already used for disaster forecasting and management and add the elements that are necessary to make them working efficiently and in harm under the same objective.

Once a disaster occurs, an initial assessment needs to be conducted as soon as possible to determine the scope, geographical distribution, and scale of the incident. Situational awareness means being able to accurately determine what has happened, what is happening now, and what will come next, all in order to plan and coordinate the most effective response possible with the resources available. This observation phase will lead to an orientation phase suggesting both an individual as well as collective “cognition” orientation to data that is sensed and communicated.

This shift together with the rapidly changing legal and regulatory landscape has heavily impacted security assurance, governance and compliance. The information security market players have tried to provide suitable solutions to cope with issues such as i) lack of means to provide higher level of assurance (e.g continuous monitoring and auditing), ii) privacy not adequately taken into account, iii) limited transparency and iv) lack of means to streamline risk management and compliance. In the certification space this has resulted in the creation of several schemas creating an additional problem, i.e. the proliferation of certification scheme. The project EU-SEC will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing approaches for assurance and compliance.  The EU-SEC aims to create a framework under which existing, certification and assurance approaches can co-exist. The three core ideas behind the EU-SEC project are that an effective and efficient approach to trust, assurance and compliance has to: (1) balance the need of nations and business sectors to develop their specific certification schemas with the need of CSPs to reduce compliance costs (2) avoid that humans (auditors) do activities that can be performed by machines (e.g. collecting data) (3) make sure that accurate and reliable evidences/information are provided to relevant people, in a timely fashion, leveraging as much as possible automatic means. The EU-SEC framework will equip stakeholders in the ICT security ecosystem with a validated governance structure, a reference architecture, and the corresponding set of tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current approach to security governance, risks management, assurance and compliance.

In parallel, MAGNETO will spark an ecosystem of third-party solution providers benefiting from its open, modular and reusable architectural framework and standard interfaces.\nTo achieve these objectives, MAGNETO will test and demonstrate its developments on five representative and complementary use cases (types of crime), under real-life operational conditions in the facilities of eleven different LEAs, keeping them continuously in the production loop, adopting an agile implementation methodology and a multi-disciplinary scientific approach, combining researchers with exceptional track records, officers with top-level operational know-how in law enforcement, recognised experts for legal and ethical compliance to EU and national standards, and qualified training experts for innovative curricula development.", "startDate": "2018-05-01", "endDate": "2021-04-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "786629", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/humanities/arts/modern and contemporary art/radio and television\", \"/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies\", \"/social sciences/law\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"2014-15\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"Security\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"SEC-12-FCT-2016-2017\", \"topicName\": \"Technologies for prevention, investigation, and mitigation in the context of fight against crime and terrorism\", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/786629", "beneficiaries": 23.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/humanities/arts/modern and contemporary art/radio and television\", \"/social sciences/law/law enforcement agencies\", \"/social sciences/law\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Security", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "SEC-12-FCT-2016-2017", "topicName": "Technologies for prevention, investigation, and mitigation in the context of fight against crime and terrorism", "tags": null}, {"id": 384.0, "foreign_id": "f60bd3c3487519ff59e6811291658c915710f1e8", "name": "ARESIBO - Augmented Reality Enriched Situation awareness for Border security", "amount": 6999882.5, "description": "ARESIBO aims at improving the efficiency of the border surveillance systems by providing the operational teams and the tactical command and control level with an accurate and comprehensive information. The pillars of research in ARESIBO are three-fold: 1. Set-up a complete configuration at tactical and execution level to optimise the collaboration between human and sensors (fixed and mobile), 2. Improve situation awareness by enhancing the understanding of the situation through adapted processing of sensor data, correlation between heterogeneous data and information and creation of knowledge through deep learning techniques and 3. Create a situation awareness capability at C2 level that will combine reports on previous missions, real time situation understanding and threat analysis for future actions. This capability will be used to optimise the operations (teams deployment and sensor positioning) as well as an online briefing tool for the teams that will be able to access to the results of the previous missions while in the field. ARESIBO integrates research activities in the domain of 1. surveillance platforms (air, ground, surface, underwater) to optimise the collaborative capabilities of the platforms and their positioning (between themselves and with the teams), 2. Sensor processing to interpret, fuse and correlate all the data to produce information and knowledge and 3. Augmented reality techniques to elaborate and provide to the operators a situation awareness picture which is fit for their missions (minimum information for maximal understanding) both as team level and tactical C2 level.

During the last 2 years, the company’s founders have been developing innovative UAV platforms, software applications, payloads, and material technologies. AERDRON has been actively developing an aerial monitoring solution called EXTREMDRON. The EXTREMDRON series of UAVs addresses many of the limitations of products currently available in terms of environmental limitations, material performance, security applications, operating envelope, and flight performance. The EXTREMDRON can operate in extreme environments which would keep other UAVs grounded during security/public safety critical events. \n\nOur last project, ED1 EXTREMDRON was another step in AERDRON strategic roadmap for developing high tech, and industrialized UAVs for professional sensing applications. The ED1 is equipped with a proprietary developed software that configures sensors, cameras, and encrypts communications thru an onboard computer. The ED1 was fully designed, engineered, and manufactured in house per our company’s commitment to home grown innovation.\n\nAERDRON recognizes that Europe/world faces increasing security threats against its civilians, and critical/soft infrastructure targets. The frequency of attacks against civilian soft targets in Europe is alarming, and new technologies must be developed in the coming years to create a counterforce multiplier. There is a real need for aerial monitoring/sensing solutions focused on the protection of heavily populated areas, and critical/soft infrastructures. AERDRON proposal EXTREMDRON focuses on a creating a NexGen UAV for aerial monitoring applications in extreme operating environments (fires, radiation/nuclear, hazardous chemicals). This niche UAV application has not been successfully realized by any products currently on the market, and there is a real world need for these capabilities to save lives, and critical infrastructures. The EXTREMDRON provides a means to monitor and collect data in extreme environments for security agencies to analyze, collect data, identify threats, and means to rapidly respond to life critical situations which ground crews cannot enter an area for safety reasons. The EXTREMDRON also provides industries/government agencies the means to measure dangerous airborne substances at the disaster location, and its dissipation over populated areas. The EXTREMDRON will be a valuable tool in protecting public safety, and critical infrastructures.  \n\nAERDRON plans to carry out a small-scale demonstration of our innovative prototype EXTREMDRON with the aim of adjusting the physical scale of the UAV (ED2).

Presently, there are obvious concerns about the possibility of using drones for terrorist attacks in which drones could be equipped with explosives and biological weapons. The development of new and efficient tools able to detect and jam civilian drones used for illegal proposes has become a priority in the security field.\nMyDefence aims to pursue a major market opportunity through the development of an innovative drone alarm and protection system (DAPS) to be used by security services providers and critical infrastructure owners - public and private sectors - in urban contexts.\nDAPS is a scalable, networked system with hardware and embedded software algorithms coupled to a graphical user interface. DAPS is able to detect and identify illegal drones around secure areas and to jam the device in a specific wireless frequency range without interfering with other mobile signals and forcing a controlled drone landing.\nWhereas the core technology is already demonstrated in an operational environment, the further maturation of the concept into a fully commercial and scalable solution is hampered due to the existence of technical and non-technical barriers. Therefore, there is a need to further establish market and regulatory feasibility of the proposed DAPS concept. Also, demonstrate and validate both the technical and economic viability of DAPS at the level of different security applications.\nInitially, this will require a Phase 1 feasibility study that will give us a clear direction for our demonstration and market replication strategies.

These critical infrastructures are potential targets for which cyber-attacks could be potentially devastating. Due to the increasing use of web applications in any sector, attacks are very often based on exploiting web application vulnerabilities, being currently vulnerable almost any web application. The software frameworks and programming environments used to develop web applications do not provide adequate functionalities to eliminate web security risks, and the current cyber security solutions (represented mainly by WAF solutions) do not cover the end-users’ needs properly (due to their complex and costly deployment and maintenance). Moreover, the protection level they offeris limited (up to 75% of risks). To overcome this situation, this project presents HDIV, a technology that follows a security by design approach, generating self-protected web applications. HDIV is integrated within the web applications and within the web application development environments. It eliminates the complexity and maintenance cost of WAF solutions and increases the protection levels up to 90%.\nThe MAIN OBJECTIVE of the project is to accelerate the introduction into the worldwide market of a set of products based on HDIV, contributing to solve the important threats derived from web application weaknesses.

The technology addresses the public urban piping systems, e.g. for water, gas or district heating, which are today almost fully mechanical, manually controlled and extremely vulnerable with respect to criminal interventions or terroristic attacks. The ACT4INFRA technology has been developed within the past years by the German SME company 3S-Antriebe GmbH. Core of the innovation is a patented rotationally locked support plate (‘System Berliner Kappe’), which enables retrofitting of automated actuators in already existing valves without flanging and without a manhole. Additionally, the actuators have been optimized for low energy consumption and can operate fully decentralized powered by batteries. The entire system is controlled by safety-approved wireless communication systems, fulfilling the strong requirements of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). No construction work for cabling and no switching cabinet is required. The ACT4INFRA system is a key enabling technology for low cost  retrofitting in order to protect vital urban infrastructure against unauthorized access. This allows to implement smart and secure networks of piping systems. Within ACT4INFRA, 3S strives for systematic market development, distribution strategy and effective international commercialization of this technology on abroad, international mass markets.

As a result theft, people trafficking and narcotics smuggling are rampant. An estimated 8% of medicine sold worldwide is counterfeit (Source: WHO 2015). Improper storage is detected too late to prevent waste. In addition, inspection delays are a major cost in the total supply chain.\n\nBabbler uses IoT and an inverted evidence principle to provide much better assurance of cargo security problems. In 2015 we were selected for an accelerator in the EU FIWARE program and in that accelerator won a cash prize for best startup in 2016. The accelerator provided funding so we could create and test a solution for shipping containers with business partners (Royal FloraHolland, Dutch Customs Organisation, Seatrade and others). \n\nAlthough Babbler proved its value in those trials and is attracting international interest, the shipping industry is conservative and slow-moving. To use Babbler a number of links in the supply chain have to decide to work together, which makes the buying process slow.

The underlying concept of DOGANA is that Social Vulnerabilities Assessments (SVAs), when regularly performed with the help of an efficient framework, help deploy effective mitigation strategies and lead to reducing the risk created by modern Social Engineering 2.0 attack techniques. Two relevant features of the proposed framework are: i) the presence of the 'awareness' component within the framework as the cornerstone of the mitigation activities; ii) the legal compliance by design of the whole framework, that will be ensured by a partner and a  work package explicitly devoted to this task. Moreover, the outcomes of the project are also expected to provide a solid basis to revise the insurance models for cyber-attacks related risks, thanks to the involvement of 2 strong DOGANA partners in this area of activity.  \nThe project will be implemented by a consortium of 18 partners, from 11 different countries, including users, technology providers of whom 3 are major world-wide cyber-security solutions market leaders as well as legal and psychological expertise.

Current sensors used nowadays (Cameras, ultrasonic sensors, etc.) are devices that are normally visible to the individuals, and have limited capability of discrimination between objects and people. Also the continuous monitoring is performed normally by cameras that make the solution complex and expensive (large amount of data to store and to process).  WARDIAM PERIMETER sensors allow preventive detection, continuous monitoring and discrimination, and are easily camouflaged, and in the case of an event (preventive or effective intrusion), the cameras can start functioning to show the intruder to the security personnel. Apart from these innovative features, WARDIAM PERIMETER has superior advantages such as cost reductions, in the capex (systems, installations) and in the opex (maintenance). This proposal is key to ONTECH, as Industrial Protection has been identified by ONTECH as the Core Business for the Company, after successfully developed a product for the Home Security market.\nWARDIAM PERIMETER key technology (CMF sensors) has been demonstrated in a industrially relevant environment (Home security).

KNOX detects and identifies civilian drones and protects infrastructures and mobile soft targets against drones’ threats.\nDrones are quickly moving from being mainly a military technology to a mass market gadget. Whereas demand and applications for drones are fast-growing, the drone market also raises security and privacy concerns. Presently, there are obvious concerns about the possibility of using drones for illicit purposes and terrorist attacks in which drones could be equipped with explosives, biological or chemical weapons. \n MyDefence has developed an innovative drone alarm able to detect, identify and locate civilian drones around secure areas, and to jam in a specific wireless frequency range without interfering with other mobile signals and forcing a controlled drone landing. KNOX is also an early warning of drones’ activity and helps to locate the pilot before the accident/attack takes place. KNOX is expected to be a game changing solution for drone detection and protection in urban contexts. \nThe present innovation project will focus on demonstrating the full KNOX solution including tactical operating procedures in 2 prisons and in 2 sports stadiums in Denmark and UK. This will be the first step towards showcasing the full concept and validating the solution under real operational environments, thus representing a key milestone for overcoming prevailing market entrance barriers for MyDefence.

Cyber attacks are made mostly against governments and corporates to gather guarded information, or to disrupt their operation in general. Advanced attackers targeted 5 out of 6 large companies each month in 2014, whereas 60% of all targeted attacks struck small- and medium-sized organisations. The same year companies across all industries worldwide have reported a total of 42.8 million detected\nattacks. And the consequences are varied and serious: crime involving computers and networks has cost the world economy more than $445 billion annually and the cost is expected to reach 1 trillion in 2016. Restroring damages caused by successful cyber attacks is extremely difficult and costly, if not impossible. Moreover, when a security breach occurs, the company or organisation concerned not only loses valuable and/or sensitive data, but it also suffers damage to its brand and reputation that can take a lot of time and money to repair.

SAFETY4RAILS concentrates on rush hour rail transport scenarios where many passengers are using metros and railways to commute to work or attend mass events (e.g. large multi-venue sporting events such as the Olympics). When an incident occurs during heavy usage, metro and railway operators have to consider many aspects to ensure passenger safety and security, e.g. carry out a threat analysis, maintain situation awareness, establish crisis communication and response, and they have to ensure that mitigation steps are taken and communicated to travellers and other users. SAFETY4RAILS will improve the handling of such events through a holistic approach.  It will analyse the cyber-physical resilience of metro and railway systems and deliver mitigation strategies for an efficient response, and, in order to remain secure given ever-changing novel emerging risks, it will facilitate continuous adaptation of the SAFETY4RAILS solution; this is validated by two rail transport operators and the results supporting the re-design of the final prototype.", "startDate": "2020-10-01", "endDate": "2022-09-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "883532", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"Work Programme 2018-20\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"Protecting the infrastructure of Europe and the people in the European smart cities\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"SU-INFRA01-2018-2019-2020\", \"topicName\": \"Prevention, detection, response and mitigation of combined physical and cyber threats to critical infrastructure in Europe\", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883532", "beneficiaries": 30.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "Work Programme 2018-20", "callId": null, "callName": "Protecting the infrastructure of Europe and the people in the European smart cities", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "SU-INFRA01-2018-2019-2020", "topicName": "Prevention, detection, response and mitigation of combined physical and cyber threats to critical infrastructure in Europe", "tags": null}, {"id": 484.0, "foreign_id": "d54420e500deb018292f592d02d24b6f71fc225b", "name": "SmartResilience - Smart Resilience Indicators for Smart Critical Infrastructures", "amount": 4809948.75, "description": "'Modern critical infrastructures are becoming increasingly “smarter” (e.g. cities).

If making existing infrastructure “smarter” is achieved by making it more complex, would it also make it more vulnerable? Would this affect resilience of an SCI as its ability to anticipate, prepare for, adapt and withstand, respond to, and recover?\nThese are the main questions tackled by this proposal.\nThe proposal envisages answering the above questions in several steps. (#1) By identifying existing indicators suitable for assessing resilience of SCIs. (#2) By identifying new “smart” resilience indicators (RIs) – including those from Big Data. (#3) By developing a new advanced resilience assessment methodology (TRL4) based on smart RIs (“resilience indicators cube”, including the resilience matrix). (#4) By developing the interactive “SCI Dashboard” tool. (#5) By applying the methodology/tools in 8 case studies, integrated under one virtual, smart-city-like, European case study. The SCIs considered (in 8 European countries!) deal with energy, transportation, health, water…\nResults #2, #3, #4 and #5 are a breakthrough innovation.\nThis approach will allow benchmarking the best-practice solutions and identifying the early warnings, improving resilience of SCIs against new threats and cascading and ripple effects.

This project directly aims to realize, integrate and demonstrate the use of a European infrastructure for mix-nets in the context of three diverse high-value applications that have clear, measurable, realistic, and achievable objectives. Our objectives are as follows. (Objective 1): Building a Mix-Net Infrastructure for Europe, by creating a European mix-network open-source codebase and infrastructure, (Objective 2): apply our infrastructure to private electronic voting protocols, where anonymity is necessary to guarantee ballot secrecy, and verifiability is needed for holding fair, transparent and trustworthy elections; (Objective 3): apply our infrastructure to privacy-aware cloud data-handling, in the context of privacy-friendly surveying, statistics and big data gathering protocols, where protecting the identity of the surveyed users is necessary to elicit truthful answers and incentivize participation; (Objective 4): apply our infrastructure to privacy-preserving messaging, where two or more users may communicate privately without third parties being able to track what is said or who-is-talking-to-whom. PANORAMIX facilitates a genuine collaboration between academia, civil society and industry bringing together a team of researchers from academia with a proven track record on privacy technologies and industry in domains where privacy technologies can have a very high impact.'", "startDate": "2015-09-01", "endDate": "2019-01-31", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "653497", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/social sciences/political science/government systems/civil society\", \"/social sciences/economics and business\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/big data\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"2014-15\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"Digital Security: Cybersecurity, Privacy and Trust\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"DS-01-2014\", \"topicName\": \"Privacy\", \"tags\": []}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653497", "beneficiaries": 10.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/political science/government systems/civil society\", \"/social sciences/economics and business\", \"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/data science/big data\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Digital Security: Cybersecurity, Privacy and Trust", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "DS-01-2014", "topicName": "Privacy", "tags": null}, {"id": 494.0, "foreign_id": "2e9dff7292d143d2eaee3fb3c01d0059c2dfb0cc", "name": "MARGIN - Tackle Insecurity in Marginalized Areas", "amount": 1881399.5, "description": "The MARGIN project coordination activities are intended to contribute to the creation of sustainable modes of cooperation between stakeholders dealing with security issues. The project provides policy makers with evidence-based tools for developing and assessing strategies targeted at the reduction of insecurity among different demographic and socioeconomic groups. It sets up an international environment for knowledge exchange involving some of the leading EU institutions in Crime Victimization Surveys (CVSs). Along with police statistics, CVSs have become an internationally recognized tool for identifying and analysing factors affecting public and personal perceptions of insecurity. Perception of insecurity arises as a very heterogeneous concept not limited to actual crime rates but encompassing a wide range of other aspects including personal wellbeing, trust in public institutions, justice and social integration. MARGIN addresses the topic of insecurity by taking into account its heterogeneity. Based on previous and on-going research activities, the project's specific aims are: (1) to create a framework enabling end-users to contrast objective and subjective measures of insecurity (i.e. compare police statistics with CVS data), (2) to develop and validate a thematic survey with a sample of 15.400 citizens that allows for the assessment of the impact of demographic, socio-economic and socio-geographic variables on the perception of insecurity (3) to investigate the socio-cultural determinants of insecurity perception through the implementation of anthropological fieldwork in five EU countries (4) to share best practices and outcomes in a final event with 100 key end-users. By deepening the understanding of the root causes of insecurity, MARGIN is expected to foster the creation of community resilience practices empowering citizens (especially among those at risk of exclusion) to better face risks and increase the public and personal perception of security.", "startDate": "2015-05-01", "endDate": "2017-04-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "653004", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"2014-15\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"Fight against crime and Terrorism\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"FCT-13-2014\", \"topicName\": \"Factors affecting (in-) security\", \"tags\": [\"Police\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/653004", "beneficiaries": 7.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Fight against crime and Terrorism", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "FCT-13-2014", "topicName": "Factors affecting (in-) security", "tags": "[\"Police\"]"}, {"id": 495.0, "foreign_id": "cb71f5dee66306e9c6099a2efd08dd1b932cecd5", "name": "SIXTHSENSE - Smart integrated extreme environment health monitor with sensory feedback for enhanced situation awareness", "amount": 7242442.5, "description": "SIXTHSENSE is a multidisciplinary innovation and research action with the overall aim to significantly improve efficacy and safety of first responders’ deployment in hazardous environments by optimising on-site team coordination and mission execution. \nBetween the booming EU economy and the climate change, the number and consequences of disasters occurring in inaccessible rural areas is on a constant rise. First responder deployments in extreme conditions such as fighting wildfires or alpine search and rescue missions have gone from exceptional to regular events in only a couple of decades. As this trend is likely to continue, the risks for wellbeing of the engaged first responders continue to grow. To avoid the loss of life or lasting consequences on the first responders’ health, it is important that the key physiological parameters of deployed operatives are monitored in a way that provides timely and actionable information, without hindering their operational capacity. \nThe SIXTHSENSE is a wearable health monitoring system with closed loop tactile biofeedback, that allows first responders in hazardous situations to sense their current health status. It allows early detection of risk factors that could lead to rapid deterioration of health or operation capabilities of first responders, by leveraging predictive models based on multimodal biosensor data. As a team management tool it enables real-time monitoring of all deployed operatives, helping increase team effectiveness and operational safety.\nTo help accelerate the pace of technological advancements aimed at first responders, beyond the scope of the project, SIXTHSENSE will establish a novel research methodology for sustainable inclusion of first responders in a co-development process.

Recent initiatives to upgrade power systems into smart grids target an even tighter integration with information technologies to enable the integration of renewable energy sources, local and bulk generation and demand response. To fully estimate the security of an enterprise’s system architecture, a large number of issues must be considered. Enterprise systems security managers must be able to assess how vulnerabilities in one system influence vulnerabilities in other systems. In addition, security managers must be able to assess how individual vulnerabilities influence the security of the entire system of systems, given the protection solutions that are used in different locations in the architecture. The project will deliver and validate a tool that helps to 1) better understand current cyber security levels across complex enterprise-wide architectures, including relationships and interdependencies between systems, 2) prioritize areas to address and cyber security investments to pursue and 3) proactively manage cyber security e.g. when building or modifying architectures. The solution is based on a cybersecurity metamodel that 1) describes the qualitative structure (which assets, attacks and defences that should be included, and how these should be associated and 2) populates this qualitative structure with quantitative data (how likely different attacks are to succeed given the system parameter values and the presence or absence of different defences, using Bayesian networks).

As maritime smuggling from Morocco towards the European borders of Portugal and Spain was combatted more effectively, the criminal modus operandi changed drastically, approaching air routes with cheap and small planes. New drone technology opens opportunity to both manned and unmanned airborne drug transports. Launched from any location and moving at low altitude and speed to mask their presence with the present clutter environment, drones can autonomously reach any landing site under nearly all circumstances.\nThe ALFA system bridges this detection capability gap by drastically improving the situational awareness through the detection of LSS (Low, Small and Slow) manned and unmanned aircraft. ALFA is future-ready as technologies for drone detection will be a part of the system, which will use heterogeneous, easy-to-deploy mobile sensors based on several novel technologies. All sensor data, augmented by other existing sources of information, will be combined using evolved data fusion, providing accurate positional data for targets including eventual indication of the air vehicle type and reliable prediction of its landing site. This information will be communicated to the regional law enforcement units using a secure communication link and mobile device application, drastically improving the reaction time.\nFinal ALFA capabilities will be demonstrated in a realistic operational context using relevant targets and in close cooperation with two principal end users taking part in the consortium. With their active participation, the ALFA system will make a significant contribution to the development of EUROSUR (in particular, cooperating with SIVE and SIVICC) and be suitable for a range of other missions and scenarios such as homeland and event protection and the protection of critical infrastructure.", "startDate": "2017-01-01", "endDate": "2019-12-31", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "700002", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/social sciences/law\", \"/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/robotics/autonomous robots/drones\", \"/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport\", \"/engineering and technology/mechanical engineering/vehicle engineering/aerospace engineering/aircraft\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"2014-15\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"Border Security & External Security\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"BES-04-2015\", \"topicName\": \"Detection of low flying aircraft at near shore air space\", \"tags\": [\"Drones\", \"Borders\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700002", "beneficiaries": 9.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/social sciences/law\", \"/engineering and technology/electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering/electronic engineering/robotics/autonomous robots/drones\", \"/social sciences/social and economic geography/transport\", \"/engineering and technology/mechanical engineering/vehicle engineering/aerospace engineering/aircraft\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "2014-15", "callId": null, "callName": "Border Security & External Security", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "BES-04-2015", "topicName": "Detection of low flying aircraft at near shore air space", "tags": "[\"Drones\", \"Borders\"]"}, {"id": 515.0, "foreign_id": "0bc596a3a40a4a447a59e6ca8e77354daf713a47", "name": "REACT - REactively Defending against Advanced Cybersecurity Threats", "amount": 2726461.25, "description": "Security is a vital property for every operational system and network. As systems become more powerful and, in many aspects, more complex, advanced cyber-attacks impose new threats for important operations of our society. Computer systems assist core functions of hospitals, energy centers, logistics, and communications, to name a few, and compromising such systems may have severe consequences for everyone of us. Despite the evolution of computer systems, current security defenses-although they have been substantially improved in the last decade-seem not really enough to stop advanced cyber attacks. Systems still suffer from vulnerabilities, despite the many active or passive defenses in place that have been developed in the last decades.\n\nWe believe that the core of this problem is that cyber attackers are almost always one step ahead of the cyber security researchers and practitioners. Indeed, cyber attackers are the first to strike, and while researchers try to figure out what happened, attackers have all the time in the world to plan their next strike. In this project we advocate that we should change the rules of the cyber attackers’ game and challenge the asymmetry. Instead of following the cyber attackers, researchers should try to forecast where attackers will strike next and to use this information (i) to fortify potential targets to withstand the attack and (ii) to wire targets up with forensic hooks and make them “forensics ready”. To make all this possible at a reasonable performance cost, we propose selective fortification, a mechanism that combines traditional passive and active defense approaches into a new reactive mode of operation.

There have been no major innovations of access covers in recent times and most remain completely unsecure and vulnerable. Requests to increase security has resulted in simple measures taken in the form of padlocks and key-locks, which still leave significant vulnerabilities. Alongside these vulnerabilities, covers in strategic sites need daily monitoring. This is currently done manually with physical inspections.

At best, there are automatic solutions to avoid abrupt incidents. Incipient as well as intermittent fault detection and isolation still occurs randomly. Also, more than 50% of Europe’s ageing infrastructure has been built before 1983, while gas consumption continues to grow. Regarding safety, although the standards and regulations enable to mostly avoid abrupt failures, the current maintenance requirements incur excessive costs for gas grid operators. E.g. in Germany, grid leakages are controlled by expensive airborne LIDAR monitoring systems. This is especially problematic in urban environments, in which most of the consumers are situated- without viable alternatives, grid operators must accept the cost.\n\nNevertheless, recent advancements in remote measurement technologies enable to develop substantially more effective grid monitoring solutions. For example, THE Systems and its team has already proven the viability of networked accelerometers for continuous grid monitoring tasks (THE Systems has tested the solution in an industrial environment in Finland).\n\nAs a result of this project, THE Systems will combine state of the art accelerometers with advanced signal processing based on computationally efficient algorithms. The uniqueness for urban settings stems from the nodes’ highly effective dampening features and the algorithm’s non-parametric, multivariate, and non-linear characteristics that operate despite high rates of random noise. Thus, it will be possible for grid operators to continuously detect and isolate faults in urban gas networks in an economically feasible manner. The broader impact will be an increase in urban gas grid safety, and at least a 50% reduction in respective grid maintenance costs.

Liquefaction is a phenomenon, with previously a low profile until recent earthquake events, in which the stiffness and strength of soil is reduced by seismic activity. With the causes of Liquefaction being known, it is important to recognize the factors that contribute to its occurrence; as well as the resulting hazards.

I-REACT integrates existing services, both local and European, into a platform that supports the entire emergency management cycle. Leveraging on innovative cyber technologies and ICT systems, I-REACT will be able to enable early planning of disaster risk reduction actions, achieve effective preparedness thanks to risk assessment and early warnings, and efficiently manage emergency responses by empowering first-responders with up-to-date situational information and by engaging citizens through crowdsourcing approaches and social media analysis. I-REACT will integrate multiple systems and European assets, including the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), and European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (E-GNSS), e.g. Galileo and EGNOS.I-REACT will be structured as a user-driven project, integrating the requirements from all main stakeholders as well as the guidelines that emerged during European workshops and seminars related to emergency management.

The need for more agility in software development and maintenance has also fostered the transition to micro-services architectures, and the wide adoption of this paradigm has led service developers to protect their applications by including virtualised instances of security appliances in their design. Unfortunately, this often results in security being managed by people without enough skills or specific expertise, it may not be able to cope with threats coming from the virtualization layer itself (e.g., hypervisor bugs), and also exposes security appliances to the same threats as the other application components. It also complicates legal interception and investigation when some applications or services are suspected of illegal activity.\nTo overcome the above limitations, the ASTRID project aims at shifting the detection and analysis logic outside of the service graph, by leveraging descriptive context models and their usage in ever smarter orchestration logic, hence shifting the responsibility for security, privacy, and trustworthiness from developers or end users to service providers. This approach brings new opportunities for situational awareness in the growing domain of virtualised services: unified access and encryption management, correlation of events and information among different services/applications, support for legal interception and forensics investigation.\nASTRID will develop a common approach easily portable to different virtualisation scenarios.

Since serious and organised tax crimes often involve cross-border activities, requiring cooperation across national jurisdictions a shared understanding of risks, threats and security measures will improve European law enforcement practices. PROTAX will produce innovative solutions boosting evolutionary development towards a genuine and sustainable European approach, significantly reducing the damages for European societies caused by criminals in the financial sector.\nPROTAX adopts a five-pronged approach. 1. We use case studies of tax crimes to investigate the roles of various actors. 2. We conduct focus groups with stakeholders in Member States. 3. We focus on the role of professional enablers as facilitators allowing illicit financial flows through legitimate institutions. 4.We map out various legal and enforcement approaches across the EU. 5.

These threats must be tackled under a holistic approach and pointing at their different origins, including the human factor. The European Union is reinforcing the legal framework to contribute to this need, including important requirements to be fulfilled, especially in the context of critical sectors identified under the NIS Directive. Finance is one of them, actually the most restrictive, because of the number of regulations to comply with. This makes finance the perfect scenario for testing tools, before transferring the results to other sectors. That is why SOTER is mainly focused on it, aiming at providing a comprehensive set of tools that will act as a transformative process of the finance sector, helping their players to increase their cybersecurity level, enabling the fight against present and future cyberattacks and vulnerabilities. The results will then increase their cyber-resilience.\nSOTER main results will be: SOTER Digital Onboarding Platform (the technology tool to provide a robust and sovereign digital identity, facilitating the interconnections between different services providers and the users), improved by the use of blockSOTER will offer tools that are able to determine the level of cyber security that exists in a certain entity, to improve if that is the case.

Filling the need and gap in the marker for highly-portable, broadly-specific decontamination methods, Aquila BioScience has developed a novel Glyco-DeCon system. At the development stage the unique combination of sugars capturing biothreat agents was identified by using a novel microarray technology. In the Glyco-DeCon wipe, the sugars are chemically attached to the surface of a pre-treated, self-contained cellulose-based material. This approach targets natural binding sites of the biothreat agents and offers a non-toxic alternative to the harsh chemical decontamination methods. The Glyco-DeCon wipe is the safest method for biological decontamination described so far and can be used on human skin as well as the delicate surfaces of the mucosal epithelia or the human eye. Moreover, the product uses natural compounds like cotton and purified proteins reducing the environmental burden of toxic chemical approaches. The Glyco-DeCon kit is intended to become part of all first responder kits.\n\nThe Glyco-DeCon wipes have already been tested in Defence accredited labs and confirmed to be effective against persistent biothreat agents, including anthrax cells and spores. Over the next six months Aquila BioScience is intending to perform field testing for the prototype developed with support of Irish Defence Forces and will discuss the most suitable formats with the end users.

Indeed, if users are strongly identified during a transaction, then privacy is non-existent. Nevertheless, there exist mechanisms that can reconcile privacy and strong identity, either by trusting an online identity provider (IDP), or by using cryptographic mechanisms such as anonymous credentials.\n \nThe former approach, made popular by technologies such as SAML, OpenID Connect, and Facebook Connect, has the disadvantage that the IDP forms a single point of failure in terms of privacy and security, because it can impersonate and track its users online. The latter approach has the disadvantage that users have to rely on trusted hardware such as smartcards to protect credentials from compromise and from illegitimate sharing.\n \nOLYMPUS will take a radically new approach offering the seamless user experience of online IDPs, but without their drawbacks. Namely, OLYMPUS will pioneer the concept of distributed oblivious identity management, where the role of the IDP is split over multiple authorities, so that no single authority can track or impersonate their users. By exploiting advanced techniques based on threshold cryptography, the OLYMPUS framework will let users maintain unlinkable identities with different service providers while using standard devices and a single password or biometric.\n \nBy leveraging existing eID solutions to create a strong link to physical identities, and by integrating into existing frameworks to ease adoption by service providers, OLYMPUS will establish a secure and interoperable European identity management framework.

To address this challenge, PROFILE seeks to accelerate the uptake of state-of-the-art data analytics and incorporation of new data sources for more effective and efficient European customs risk management. The project provides tailored solutions, that build on modern methods in machine learning, graph-based analytics, and natural language processing, to help targeting officers and strategic analysts to collect and organise unstructured data, data-mine large datasets, apply semi-supervised machine learning that utilises feedback of control results, and to visualize complex data sets. PROFILE enables customs-to-customs systematic sharing of Entry Summary Declarations and other risk-relevant information through the EU-wide PROFILE Risk Data Sharing Architecture (RDSA). The project also connects national customs risk management systems to logistics Big Data of INTTRA and the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and provides customs an improved access to online data, especially valuation-relevant data of e-commerce sites. PROFILE also strengthens cooperation and data exchange among customs and other competent authorities. Better access to data, customised state-of-the-art data analytics, and stronger cooperation will provide the customs an enhanced 360º view on cross-border cargo flows.

In 2000 41 significant attacks on aid workers were recorded across the globe. By 2014, that number had risen to 190. In this 15-year period, over 3,000 aid workers have been killed, injured or kidnapped. Despite the increasing availability of tracking and monitoring technologies, the number of humanitarian workers that fall victim to attacks continues to rise. Clearly, a novel and innovative approach to tracking and decision-making is needed.  \nInformation systems for fleet management, GPS for navigation and location or RFID tags for inventory management are just a few of the technologies that have changed the humanitarian operations. Until now, however, there is no integrated decision support system that provides real-time analyses from the data streams that are generated by these technologies.  This lack of integrated real-time information prevents an understanding of potentially threatening situations, increases response times and creates insecure communications, all leading to inadequate protection and hampered efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe aim of better protection and more efficient and effective operations can only be achieved by devel-oping technologies along with the policies for their use. GPS, for example, notwithstanding its capability to provide live tracking of vehicles for recovery, cannot prevent an ambush or kidnapping. Technologies therefore need to go hand in hand with procedures and policies in order to provide useful early warnings to decision-makers on the ground as well as decision support for scheduling, navigation, risk management and coordination. Policies, in other words, provide for the essential guidance on how to use the technologies in the field.

Concealed surveillance devices can provide irrefutable evidences, but current video surveillance systems are usually bulky and complicated, are often used as simple video recorders, and require complex, expensive infrastructure to supply power, bandwidth, storage and illumination.  \nRecent years have seen significant advances in the surveillance industry, but these were rarely targeted to forensic applications. The imaging community is fixated on cameras for mobile phones, where the figures of merit are resolution, image quality, and low profile. A mobile phone with its camera on would consume its battery in under two hours. Industrial surveillance cameras are even more power hungry, while intelligent algorithms such as face detection often require extremely high processing power, such as backend server farms, and are not available in conventional surveillance systems.  \n\nHere we propose to develop and validate a novel, ultra-low-power, intelligent, miniaturised, low-cost, wireless, autonomous sensor (“FORENSOR”) for evidence gathering. Its ultra-sensitive camera and built-in intelligence will allow it to operate at remote locations, automatically identify pre-defined criminal events, and alert LEAs in real time while providing and storing the relevant video, location and timing evidence. FORENSOR will be able to operate for up to two months with no additional infrastructure. It will be manageable remotely, preserve the availability and the integrity of the collected evidence, and comply with all legal and ethical standards, in particular those related to privacy and personal data protection.

Reaching beyond the technology focused boundaries of classical information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity includes organizational and behavioural aspects of IT systems and also needs to comply to the currently actively developing legal and regulatory framework for cybersecurity. For example, the European Union recently passed the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive that obliges member states to get in line with the EU strategy. While large corporations might have the resources to follow those developments and bring their IT infrastructure and services in line with the requirements, the burden for smaller organizations like local public administration will be substantial and the required resources might not be available.\nNew and innovative solutions that will help local public administration to ease the burden of being in line with cybersecurity requirements are needed. For example, cooperation and coordination is one of the major aspects of the NIS and EU cybersecurity strategy. An enabling technology for cooperation and coordination is cyber situational awareness and information sharing of cyber incidents. In this project we propose a cybersecurity situational awareness solution for local public administrations that, based on an analysis of the context provides automatic incident detection and visualization, and enables information exchange with relevant national and EU level NIS authorities like CERTs.

There is strong demand in the banking industry for secure biometric applications. In fact, in May 2014 the European Central Bank (ECB) published a list of recommendations for increased bank transaction security and for the first time, biometrics was included as one of most valid and securest authentication parameters. Security has been always a major concern of the banking industry, fundamentally because banks are attractive to criminals as a direct access to currency, bank notes, and user‘s personal information which can be used for identity theft (phishing and card skimming). The concerns about bank security have always been there, but it has been after the breakthrough of online and mobile banking when bank fraud has become major issue to address with urgency. Currently, whether it’s online, on a smartphone, on an ATM or on a POS (point-of-sale), the great majority of banking transactions are done by using a 4-6 digits PIN code as the way for authentication. This form of authentication is of an extremely low security level in all cases, but especially more in online banking where cybercriminals and hackers can easily obtain this PIN code in a matter of seconds. As a result, the total value of fraudulent transactions is rapidly increasing year by year, being now estimated at €1.33 billion solely in Europe.  In this scenario, biometrics holds great promise to become the gold standard authentication method for bank transactions in the near future. However, despite the clear opportunity there are still some barriers preventing the banking biometrics breakthrough, at least on a large scale. Our Facial recognition technology gathers the ideal features to overcome these barriers, representing a great opportunity to definitively bring biometric authentication to banking security.", "startDate": "2015-09-01", "endDate": "2018-11-30", "program": "Horizon 2020", "projectId": "696917", "summary": "{\"euroscivoc\": [\"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software\"], \"theme\": \"Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens\", \"workProgram\": \"Work Programme 2016-17\", \"callId\": null, \"callName\": \"SME Instrument\", \"callArea\": null, \"topicCode\": \"SMEInst-13-2016-2017\", \"topicName\": \"Engaging SMEs in security research and development\", \"tags\": [\"Facial recognition\", \"Biometrics\"]}", "sourceUrl": "https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/696917", "beneficiaries": 1.0, "programs": true, "euroscivoc": "[\"/natural sciences/computer and information sciences/software\"]", "theme": "Secure societies - Protecting freedom and security of Europe and its citizens", "workProgram": "Work Programme 2016-17", "callId": null, "callName": "SME Instrument", "callArea": null, "topicCode": "SMEInst-13-2016-2017", "topicName": "Engaging SMEs in security research and development", "tags": "[\"Facial recognition\", \"Biometrics\"]"}, {"id": 624.0, "foreign_id": "2ebc6a315e45a10d4ca6895b5b1935f14e3b0b7b", "name": "LocationWise - LocationWise Payment Card Validation: A cloud based location verification system that willsignificantly lower cost of payment card cyber security", "amount": 50000.0, "description": "The vision of LocationWise project is to lower fraud costs incurred by banks from €1.03 to €0.55 per transaction and thus saving Europe ca. €456 million annually. Card fraud directly costs the Single Euro Payments Area ca. €1.44 billion annually and €14.55 billion globally with banks bearing 62% of costs and merchants 38%. These are not the only costs associated with payment card fraud. The other cost (amounting to €13.13 billion globally) is associated with measures to handle legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly flagged as fraudulent and hence blocked, for example call centre costs and lost transaction fees. Reducing or minimising these costs is no easy solution as tightening fraud risk rules directly increases false positives while loosening them has the converse effect of increasing fraudulent transactions. Given that ca. 86% of adults carry their mobile phones with them there is a high probability that the location of the mobile device is close or the same location where a transaction is occurring. LocationWise automatically queries the user’s mobile device to determine his/her location without human intervention so that fraud detection systems can, with greater accuracy, apply location data to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions and false positives. Because of its access to the widest global mobile coverage and use of multiple verification methods, LocationWise gives the most accurate location data. This reduces the number of genuine card transactions that are incorrectly flagged (based on location) as fraudulent by 51% and the number of actual fraudulent transactions by 62%.

The proposed interdisciplinary approach will capture different phases of such emerging attacks, before and after known (even years old) or unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities have been widely exploited by cyber-criminals to launch the attack. Emphasis is given on building a proactive cyber-threat intelligence gathering and sharing system to prevent the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities. This intelligence information will be used to maintain accurate vulnerability profiles of IoT devices, in accordance with data protection, privacy, or other regulations, and optimally alter their attack surface to minimise the damage from cyber-attacks. Novel technologies will be developed, based on distributed ledgers and blockchains, to monitor devices’ integrity state and network behaviour that will considerably increase the detection and response capabilities against targeted and interdisciplinary cyber-attacks. In the case of alleged malicious activity, tools for collecting and storing forensic evidence on a tamper-proof blockchain structure will be delivered, taking into account the specific needs of law enforcement agencies.

Despite some promising approaches, still no proven method of leakages and exfiltration measurement on a wider scale is available so authorities and companies are not aware of its impact on groundwater pollution.\nIndirect measuring methods as groundwater sampling or modelling, are mostly too complicated for sewer operators to apply. Direct procedures yield exfiltration rates for single leaks, but the extrapolation to overall exfiltration rates is questionable due to the inhomogeneity of defects.\nOur technology is based on an ongoing monitoring plan to anticipate the consequences of leakages. With the ambition of reducing the amount of Contaminants of Emerging Concern that can cause harm to the environment and human populations, and based on practical experience acquired through the Western Galilee Incident where R.Z.E.E. professionals detected an alarmant percentage of leakages (20%), we developed and patented an unique technology, “Any Geometry Flume”, a system adapted to measure gravitational flows in a simple, precise and relatively inexpensive way.\nWith the development of VIGI-LEAK, we aim to complement our technology with a highly precise real-time flow measurement software. VIGI-LEAK is a correlation system located in the 'internet cloud' to monitor sewage systems and alert if there is a fault or malfunction in some segment, calculating the magnitude of the leakage.

Estimates of global financial losses due to cyber-crime are at least €350 billion per year and are expected to reach €1.89 trillion by 2019. Cyber-crime has led to the loss of up to 150,000 jobs in Europe, which is about 0.6% of the total unemployed population. In response to cyber-crime, we initiated ‘ConnectProtect’ in 2012, a total cyber protection service for SMEs and residential customers.\n\nWe worked with about 20 SMEs in the UK to build this service and up to date, we developed a reporting engine capable of correlating events/logs from multiple security products across multiple organisations and constantly updating each event in real-time to generate the relevant classification of potential threat. The report engine is able to generate a case for our engineers to deal with an incident in real-time and allowing the customer to view their security state via a dashboard. We aim to further establish and understand our target market and conduct a detailed Europe wide cyber-security market study to establish the size and dynamics of the small business market; engage developmental, operational, and marketing partners for successful delivery of this project.\n\nWe also seek to develop an Intellectual Property (IP) strategy to protect our solution from exploitation by other parties. Through this project we will reduce the cyber security burden in the EU from an average of €280 to between €10 and €70 per employee per month and we will create over 100 jobs through native sales language teams that would be set up in our various target countries.

The ideal solution is a robust in-situ method for rapid non-invasive detection of hazardous materials, including explosives, that is portable and can be located at borders, ports and other sensitive targets around Europe.\nThe most powerful and promising method being adopted for in-situ observations of suspicious substances to detect explosive is Raman spectroscopy.

These micro enterprises (MEnts) are responsible for 30% and 21% of the overall employment and value added in the EU, respectively. However, when it refers to the imminent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)’s application, MEnts are the most vulnerable due to their lack of expertise and resources to invest in their adoption. It is urgent to develop solutions that assist MEnts in smoothly adopting the GDPR, safeguarding the interests of the EU citizens on data privacy and security, avoiding the negative socioeconomic consequences entailed to breaches for MEnts, and, by extension, benefitting the European society. SMOOTH project addresses this challenge from two complementary focuses:\n1) Creating awareness on the importance of being compliant with the GDPR, as many MEnts ignore their obligations in this respect, involving as partners Data Protection Authorities and associations representing EU MEnts. For the same purpose, SMOOTH will deliver a practical GDPR interactive handbook (website and mobile app) tailored specifically to MEnts. \n2) Assisting MEnts to effectively adopt and comply with the GDPR. The SMOOTH cloud platform will use machine learning, text and data mining, and advance online auditing methods to automatically create a bespoke GDPR compliance report for the most critical aspects to MEnts. Likewise, SMOOTH will provide useful materials for solving those identified aspects of the GDPR that are not properly covered.  \nAll this will positively contribute to citizens rights, while avoiding potential fines for the MEnts that may account for as much as 4% of the annual income, according to the GDPR.

All of the cases of theft of nuclear materials where the circumstances of the theft are known were perpetrated either by insiders or with the help of insiders; given that the other cases involve bulk material stolen covertly without anyone being aware the material was missing, there is every reason to believe that they were perpetrated by insiders as well. \nThe need is to detect shielded and unshielded Special Nuclear Materials ('SNM') and radioactive materials is necessary. Radiation Monitors are effective to detect unshielded or partially shielded nuclear and radioactive materials in lightly loaded vehicles or cargos, and less effective at dense or high attenuating vehicles. In addition, the radiation monitors are not effective to detect shielding (e.g. lead) inside the vehicles that are capable to transport large masses of shielding material. Specifically, one of the biggest gaps is that some SNMs emit very low level of radiation. The X-ray cannot clear every dense object found in the image. Active interrogation can be used to clear the alarms; however, they produce high radiation that requires shielded facility, and require passengers not to remain in the vehicle during the inspection.  Therefore, there is a need for inspection systems that can penetrate high attenuating vehicles, be specific to nuclear and shielding materials and that can be steal from the sites. . Lingacom is developing an innovative Muon Detection System for detecting high-Z materials used in nuclear bombs and shielded radioactive materials (used in “dirty bombs”) in containerized cargo and vehicles.
